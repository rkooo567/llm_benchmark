"the short - term periodicities of the daily sunspot area fluctuations from august 1923 to october 1933 are discussed . for these data 
 the correlative analysis indicates negative correlation for the periodicity of about @xmath0 days , but the power spectrum analysis indicates a statistically significant peak in this time interval . 
 a new method of the diagnosis of an echo - effect in spectrum is proposed and it is stated that the 155-day periodicity is a harmonic of the periodicities from the interval of @xmath1 $ ] days .    the autocorrelation functions for the daily sunspot area fluctuations and for the fluctuations of the one rotation time interval in the northern hemisphere , separately for the whole solar cycle 16 and for the maximum activity period of this cycle do not show differences , especially in the interval of @xmath2 $ ] days . 
 it proves against the thesis of the existence of strong positive fluctuations of the about @xmath0-day interval in the maximum activity period of the solar cycle 16 in the northern hemisphere . 
 however , a similar analysis for data from the southern hemisphere indicates that there is the periodicity of about @xmath0 days in sunspot area data in the maximum activity period of the cycle 16 only ."

 we calculate generalized overlap reduction functions for the circularly polarized stochastic gravitational wave background . 
 we find that the circular polarization can not be detected for an isotropic background . however , there is a chance to observe the circular polarization for an anisotropic gravitational wave background . 
 we also show how to separate polarized gravitational waves from unpolarized gravitational waves ."

"in the hierarchical search for periodic sources of gravitational waves , the candidate selection , in the incoherent step , can be performed with hough transform procedures . in this paper 
 we analyze the problem of sensitivity loss due to discretization of the parameters space vs computing cost , comparing the properties of the sky hough procedure with those of a new frequency hough , which is based on a transformation from the _ time - observed frequency _ plane to the _ source frequency - spin down _ plane . 
 results on simulated peakmaps suggest various advantages in favor of the use of the frequency hough . the ones which show up to really make the difference are 1 ) the possibility to enhance the frequency resolution without relevantly affecting the computing cost . 
 this reduces the digitization effects ; 2 ) the excess of candidates due to local disturbances in some places of the sky map . 
 they do not affect the new analysis because each map is constructed for only one position in the sky .

"i summarize what we have learned about the nature of stars that ultimately explode as core - collapse supernovae from the examination of images taken prior to the explosion . by registering pre - supernova and post - supernova images , usually taken at high resolution using either space - based optical detectors , or ground - based infrared detectors equipped with laser guide star adaptive optics systems , nearly three dozen core - collapse supernovae 
 have now had the properties of their progenitor stars either directly measured or ( more commonly ) constrained by establishing upper limits on their luminosities . 
 these studies enable direct comparison with stellar evolution models that , in turn , permit estimates of the progenitor stars physical characteristics to be made . 
 i review progenitor characteristics ( or constraints ) inferred from this work for each of the major core - collapse supernova types ( ii - plateau , ii - linear , iib , iin , ib / c ) , with a particular focus on the analytical techniques used and the processes through which conclusions have been drawn . 
 brief discussion of a few individual events is also provided , including sn 2005gl , a type iin supernova that is shown to have had an extremely luminous  and thus very massive  progenitor that exploded shortly after a violent , luminous blue variable - like eruption phase , contrary to standard theoretical predictions ."

"evolutionary tracks and pulsational analysis of models with masses of 13 - 18 @xmath0 are presented . 
 we address two important questions . the first one deals with one of the most unresolved problems in astrophysics , i.e. , the existence of a blue loop after core helium ignition ; the so called `` to loop or not to loop '' problem . 
 we show that inward overshooting from the outer convective zone in the red giant phase is prerequisite for the development of the blue loop . 
 our second question concerns pulsational instability of models in the core helium burning phase . 
 we present for the first time that models on the blue loop can have unstable modes driven by the @xmath1 mechanism operating in the @xmath2bump . 
 contrary to post - main sequence models in the shell hydrogen burning phases , pulsational instability of the blue loop models depends mainly on effective temperature and metallicity is of secondary importance .

"we consider one - dimensional mixtures of an atomic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) and tonks - giradeau ( tg ) gas . the mixture is modeled by a coupled system of the gross - pitaevskii equation for the bec and the quintic nonlinear schrdinger equation for the tg component . 
 an immiscibility condition for the binary system is derived in a general form . under this condition , 
 three types of bec - tg interfaces are considered : domain walls ( dws ) separating the two components ; bubble - drops ( bds ) , in the form of a drop of one component immersed into the other ( bds may be considered as bound states of two dws ) ; and bound states of bright and dark solitons ( bdss ) . 
 the same model applies to the copropagation of two optical waves in a colloidal medium . 
 the results are obtained by means of systematic numerical analysis , in combination with analytical thomas - fermi approximations ( tfas ) . using both methods , families of dw states 
 are produced in a generic form . 
 bd complexes exist solely in the form of a tg drop embedded into the bec background . on the contrary , 
 bdss exist as bound states of tg bright and bec dark components , and vice versa ."
"primordial black hole ( pbh ) abundance limits constrain the primordial power spectrum , and hence models of inflation , on scales far smaller than those probed by cosmological observations . 
 single field inflation models which are compatible with all cosmological data can have large enough perturbations on small scales to overproduce pbhs , and hence be excluded . 
 the standard formulae for the amplitude of perturbations do not hold for modes that exit the horizon close to the end of inflation however . 
 we use a modified flow analysis to identify models of inflation where the amplitude of perturbations on small scales is large . for these models 
 we then carry out a numerical evolution of the perturbations and use the pbh constraints on the power spectrum to eliminate models which overproduce pbhs . 
 significant pbh formation can occur in models in which inflation can continue indefinitely and is ended via a secondary mechanism . 
 we demonstrate that pbhs constrain these types of inflation models and show that a numerical evaluation of the power spectrum decreases the number of otherwise viable models of inflation ."
"sofia is a 2.5 meter airborne infrared telescope , mounted in a boeing 747sp aircraft . due to the large size of the telescope , 
 only a few degrees of azimuth are available at the telescope bearing . 
 this means the heading of the aircraft is fundamentally associated with the telescope s observation targets , and the ground track necessary to enable a given mission is highly complex and dependent on the coordinates , duration , and order of observations to be performed . 
 we have designed and implemented a flight management infrastructure ( fmi ) product in order to plan and execute such missions in the presence of a large number of external constraints ( e.g. restricted airspace , international boundaries , elevation limits of the telescope , aircraft performance , winds at altitude , and ambient temperatures ) .

"the mutual dipole - dipole interaction of atoms in a trap can affect their fluorescence . 
 extremely large effects were reported for double jumps between different intensity periods in experiments with two and three ba@xmath0 ions for distances in the range of about ten wave lengths of the strong transition while no effects were observed for hg@xmath0 at 15 wave lengths . in this theoretical paper 
 we study this question for configurations with three and four levels which model those of hg@xmath0 and ba@xmath0 , respectively . for two systems in the hg@xmath0 configuration 
 we find cooperative effects of up to 30% for distances around one or two wave lengths , about 5% around ten wave lengths , and , for larger distances in agreement with experiments , practically none . 
 this is similar for two v systems .

 these components are generalizations of two - integral ones and can thus provide thin discs in the two - integral approximation .

 we investigate the exponential decay towards the equilibrium state , which is governed by three time scales . 
 in addition to the charge and spin relaxation time there is a third time scale which is independent of the level position and the coulomb interaction . 
 this time scale emerges in the time evolution of physical quantities sensitive to two - particle processes ."
"mesoscopic dynamics of self - organized structures is the most important aspect in the description of complex living systems . 
 the belousov  zhabotinsky ( b  z ) reaction is in this respect a convenient testbed because it represents a prototype of chemical self - organization with a rich variety of emergent wave - spiral patterns . using a multi - state stochastic hotchpotch model , 
 we show here that the mesoscopic behaviour of the non - stirred b  z 
 reaction is both qualitatively and quantitatively susceptible to the description in terms of stochastic multilevel cellular automata . 
 this further implies that the mesoscopic dynamics of the non - stirred b  z reaction results from a delicate interplay between a ) a maximal number of available states within the elementary time lag ( i.e. a minimal time interval needed for demise of a final state ) and b ) an imprecision or uncertainty in the definition of state . 
 if either the number of time lags is largely different from 7 or the maximal number of available states is smaller than 20 , the physicochemical conditions are inappropriate for a formation of the wave - spiral patterns . 
 furthermore , a white noise seems to be key for the formation of circular structures ( target patterns ) which could not be as yet systematically explained in existing models ."

"specially - designed microlensing searches , some of which have been underway for several years , are sensitive to extrasolar planets orbiting the most common stars in our galaxy . 
 microlensing is particularly well - suited to the detection of jupiter - mass planets orbiting their parent stars at several au . since jovian analogs are thought to influence the subsequent evolution of most planetary systems , they are particularly important to study . the orbital radii and distances to the planetary systems probed by microlensing are larger than those currently studied by radial velocity techniques ; the two methods are thus complementary . 
 recent results from microlensing searches are discussed , including constraints on jovian analogs orbiting typical galactic stars . 
 benefits and drawbacks of the technique for the characterization of planetary systems , and future prospects are briefly reviewed .

"masers found in massive star - forming regions can be located precisely in six - dimensional phase space and therefore serve as a tool for studying milky way dynamics . 
 the non - random orbital phases at which the masers are found and the sparseness of current samples require modeling . here we model the phase - space distribution function of 18 precisely measured galactic masers , permitting a mean velocity offset and a general velocity dispersion tensor relative to their local standards of rest , and accounting for different pieces of prior information . with priors only on the sun 
 s distance from the galactic center and on its motion with respect to the local standard of rest , the maser data provide a weak constraint on the circular velocity at the sun of @xmath0 km s@xmath1 . including prior information on the proper motion of sgr a@xmath2 leads to @xmath3 km s@xmath1 .

"using hst and the wfpc2 we have acquired very deep v- and i - band photometry of stars in ngc 2420 and ngc 2477 to study cluster luminosity functions at approximately solar metallicity . 
 we have determined these cluster luminosity functions down to @xmath0 = 10.5 ( 0.2 m@xmath1 ) and find that the luminosity function of ngc 2420 turns over at @xmath0 @xmath2 9.0 , and possibly stops altogether by @xmath0 @xmath2 9.5 . 
 the luminosity function of ngc 2477 may flatten at @xmath0 @xmath3 9.5 . 
 we compare our open cluster luminosity functions to the solar neighborhood field star luminosity function of kroupa , tout & gilmore ( 1993 ) and the four published hst globular cluster luminosity functions : @xmath4 cen ( elson _ et al . _ 
 1995 ) , 47 tuc ( de marchi & paresce 1995b ) , m 15 ( de marchi & paresce 1995a ) , and ngc 6397 ( paresce , de marchi & romaniello 1995 ) .

"we describe the design and performance of the medium resolution spectrometer ( mrs ) for the jwst - miri instrument . 
 the mrs incorporates four coaxial spectral channels in a compact opto - mechanical layout that generates spectral images over fields of view up to 7.7 x 7.7 arcseconds in extent and at spectral resolving powers ranging from 1,300 to 3,700 . 
 each channel includes an all - reflective integral field unit ( ifu ) : an ` image slicer ' that reformats the input field for presentation to a grating spectrometer . 
 two 1024 x 1024 focal plane arrays record the output spectral images with an instantaneous spectral coverage of approximately one third of the full wavelength range of each channel . 
 the full 5 to 28.5 @xmath0 m spectrum is then obtained by making three exposures using gratings and pass - band - determining filters that are selected using just two three - position mechanisms .

"we demonstrate that 4-body real space jastrow factors are , with the right type of jastrow basis function , capable of performing successful wave function stenciling to remove unwanted ionic terms from an overabundant fermionic reference without unduly modifying the remaining components . 
 in addition to greatly improving size consistency ( restoring it exactly in the case of a geminal power ) , real - space wave function stenciling is , unlike its hilbert space predecessors , immediately compatible with diffusion monte carlo , allowing it to be used in the pursuit of compact , strongly correlated trial functions with reliable nodal surfaces . 
 we demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in the context of a double bond dissociation by using it to extract a qualitatively correct nodal surface despite being paired with a restricted slater determinant , that , due to ionic term errors , produces a ground state with a qualitatively incorrect nodal surface when used in the absence of the jastrow ."

"we present a numerical method for calculating piecewise smooth spectral functions of correlated quantum systems in the thermodynamic limit from the spectra of finite systems computed using the dynamical or correction - vector density - matrix renormalization group method . 
 the key idea is to consider this problem as a blind deconvolution with an unknown kernel which causes both a broadening and finite - size corrections of the spectrum . in practice 
 , the method reduces to a least - square optimization under non - linear constraints which enforce the positivity and piecewise smoothness of spectral functions . 
 the method is demonstrated on the single - particle density of states of one - dimensional paramagnetic mott insulators represented by the half - filled hubbard model on an open chain .

 they consist of finite non - hermitian clusters and semi - infinite leads . based on the analysis of the solutions of the concrete systems 
 , it is shown that they can have full real spectra without any requirements on the symmetry and the wave function within the leads becomes unidirectional plane waves at the exceptional point .

"this paper gives a summary of the author s works concerning the emergent general relativity in a particular class of tensor models , which possess gaussian classical solutions . 
 in general , a classical solution in a tensor model may be physically regarded as a background space , and small fluctuations about the solution as emergent fields on the space . 
 the numerical analyses of the tensor models possessing gaussian classical background solutions have shown that the low - lying long - wavelength fluctuations around the backgrounds are in one - to - one correspondence with the geometric fluctuations on flat spaces in the general relativity . 
 it has also been shown that part of the orthogonal symmetry of the tensor model spontaneously broken by the backgrounds can be identified with the local translation symmetry of the general relativity . 
 thus the tensor model provides an interesting model of simultaneous emergence of space , the general relativity , and its local gauge symmetry of translation .

"it is a known fact that a quintessence model with @xmath0 fits the publicly available super nova ( sn ) type ia data better than a model with cosmological constant or @xmath1 . 
 two types of models have this property : scalar fields with unconventional kinetic term and models with cosmological constant and a slowly decaying cold dark matter ( cdm ) . in this work 
 we investigate the possibility of replacing the cosmological constant in the latter models with gradual condensation of a scalar field produced during the decay of the cdm and present some preliminary results . 
 the advantage of this class of models to the ordinary quintessence is that the evolution of the dark energy and cdm are correlated and cosmological coincidence problem is solved or at least reduced to the fine tuning of the coupling between decaying cdm and quintessence field i.e the hierarchy problem . 
 here we show that for part of the parameter space these models are consistent with present estimation of cosmological parameters .    *

"in this work , we have used an effective field theory ( eft ) framework based on heavy quark spin ( hqss ) , heavy flavour ( hfs ) and heavy antiquark - diquark symmetries ( hads ) . using a standard lagrangian for the heavy meson - heavy antimeson system , we fit the counter - terms of the model to predict some promising experimental data that can be interpreted as heavy meson - heavy antimeson molecules , that is , the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 . 
 next , and , taking advantage of hads , we use the same lagrangian to explore the consequences for heavy meson - doubly heavy baryon molecules , which can also be interpreted as triply heavy pentaquarks ."
"we introduce new methods for robust high - precision photometry from well - sampled images of a non - crowded field with a strongly varying point - spread function . for this work , we used archival imaging data of the open cluster m37 taken by mmt 6.5 m telescope . 
 we find that the archival light curves from the original image subtraction procedure exhibit many unusual outliers , and more than 20% of data get rejected by the simple filtering algorithm adopted by early analysis . in order to achieve better photometric precisions and also to utilize all available data , the entire imaging database was re - analyzed with our time - series photometry technique ( multi - aperture indexing photometry ) and a set of sophisticated calibration procedures . 
 the merit of this approach is as follows : we find an optimal aperture for each star with a maximum signal - to - noise ratio , and also treat peculiar situations where photometry returns misleading information with more optimal photometric index . 
 we also adopt photometric de - trending based on a hierarchical clustering method , which is a very useful tool in removing systematics from light curves . 
 our method removes systematic variations that are shared by light curves of nearby stars , while true variabilities are preserved . 
 consequently , our method utilizes nearly 100% of available data and reduce the rms scatter several times smaller than archival light curves for brighter stars . 
 this new data set gives a rare opportunity to explore different types of variability of short ( @xmath0minutes ) and long ( @xmath01 month ) time scales in open cluster stars ."
"truncated fourier , gauss , kummer and exponential sums can be used to factorize numbers : for a factor these sums equal unity in absolute value , whereas they nearly vanish for any other number . 
 we show how this factorization algorithm can emerge from superpositions of classical light waves and we present a number of simple implementations in optics ."
"statistical learning theory chiefly studies restricted hypothesis classes , particularly those with finite vapnik - chervonenkis ( vc ) dimension . 
 the fundamental quantity of interest is the sample complexity : the number of samples required to learn to a specified level of accuracy . 
 here we consider learning over the set of all computable labeling functions . 
 since the vc - dimension is infinite and a priori ( uniform ) bounds on the number of samples are impossible , we let the learning algorithm decide when it has seen sufficient samples to have learned . we first show that learning in this setting is indeed possible , and develop a learning algorithm . 
 we then show , however , that bounding sample complexity independently of the distribution is impossible . 
 notably , this impossibility is entirely due to the requirement that the learning algorithm be computable , and not due to the statistical nature of the problem ."
"electroweak corrections to longitudinal gauge and higgs boson scattering amplitudes are calculated . due to sudakov 
 double logarithms , the effect is a suppression of amplitude that grows rapidly with increasing center of mass energy leading to significant reduction of cross sections compared to tree level results . 
 for example , the suppression factor for the cross section of @xmath0 scattering due to these corrections varies from @xmath1 at the center of mass energy of @xmath2 to a factor of @xmath3 at the center of mass energy of @xmath4 . 
 the modification of sm unitarity bound due to these corrections is obtained ."
"we performed single point [ c  i ] @xmath0p@xmath1@xmath0p@xmath2 and co @xmath3=43 observations toward three t tauri stars , dm tau , lkca 15 , and tw hya , using the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) band 8 qualification model receiver installed on the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ) . 
 two protostars in the taurus l1551 region , l1551 irs 5 and hl tau , were also observed . 
 we successfully detected [ c  i ] emission from the protoplanetary disk around dm tau as well as the protostellar targets . 
 the spectral profile of the [ c  i ] emission from the protoplanetary disk is marginally single - peaked , suggesting that atomic carbon ( c ) extends toward the outermost disk . 
 the detected [ c  i ] emission is optically thin and the column densities of c are estimated to be @xmath4 @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath5 for the t tauri star targets and the protostars , respectively . 
 we found a clear difference in the total mass ratio of c to dust , @xmath7(c)/@xmath7(dust ) , between the t tauri stars and protostellar targets ; the @xmath7(c)/@xmath7(dust ) ratio of the t tauri stars is one order of magnitude smaller than that of the protostars . 
 the decrease of the estimated @xmath7(c)/@xmath7(dust ) ratios for the disk sources is consistent with a theoretical prediction that the atomic c can survive only in the near surface layer of the disk and c@xmath8/c / co transition occurs deeper into the disk midplane ."
"to study the dynamics of chemical processes , we often adopt rate equations to observe the change in chemical concentrations . 
 however , when the number of the molecules is small , the fluctuations can not be neglected . 
 we often study the effects of fluctuations with the help of stochastic differential equations . 
 chemicals are composed of molecules on a microscopic level . in principle 
 , the number of molecules must be an integer , which must only change discretely . 
 however , in analysis using stochastic differential equations , the fluctuations are regarded as continuous changes 
 . this approximation can only be valid if applied to fluctuations that involve a sufficiently large number of molecules . in the case of extremely rare chemical species , 
 the actual discreteness of the molecules may critically affect the dynamics of the system .    to elucidate the effects of the discreteness , we study an autocatalytic system consisting of several interacting chemical species with a small number of molecules through stochastic particle simulations . 
 we found novel states , which were characterized as an extinction of molecule species , due to the discrete nature of the molecules . 
 we also observed a strong dependence of the chemical concentrations on the size of the system , which was caused by transitions to the novel states ."
"we report the discovery of 42 white dwarfs in the original _ kepler _ mission field , including nine new confirmed pulsating hydrogen - atmosphere white dwarfs ( zzceti stars ) . 
 guided by the _ kepler_-int survey ( kis ) , we selected white dwarf candidates on the basis of their @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 photometric colours . 
 we followed up these candidates with high - signal - to - noise optical spectroscopy from the 4.2-m william herschel telescope . using ground - based , time - series photometry 
 , we put our sample of new spectroscopically characterized white dwarfs in the context of the empirical zzceti instability strip . prior to our search 
 , only two pulsating white dwarfs had been observed by _ 
 kepler_. ultimately , four of our new zzcetis were observed from space . 
 these rich datasets are helping initiate a rapid advancement in the asteroseismic investigation of pulsating white dwarfs , which continues with the extended _ kepler _ mission , _ k2_.    [ firstpage ]    asteroseismology , surveys , stars : white dwarfs , oscillations"
"we present a combined analysis of the low - mass initial mass function ( imf ) for seven star - forming regions . 
 we first demonstrate that the ratios of stars to brown dwarfs are consistent with a single underlying imf . by assuming that the underlying imf is the same for all seven clusters and by combining the ratio of stars to brown dwarfs from each cluster we constrain the shape of the brown dwarf imf and find it to be consistent with a lognormal imf . 
 this provides the strongest constraint yet that the substellar imf turns over ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) ."
"the robust effect of curvature on spin polarization is reported in a three - terminal bridge system where the bridging material is subjected to rashba spin - orbit interaction . 
 the results are examined considering two different geometric configurations , ring- and linear - like , of the material which is coupled to one input and two output leads . 
 our results exhibit absolute zero spin polarization for the linear sample , while finite polarization is obtained in output leads for the ring - like sample ."
"we investigate system - environment correlations based on the exact dynamics of a qubit and its environment in the framework of pure decoherence ( phase damping ) . 
 we focus on the relation of decoherence and the build - up of system - reservoir entanglement for an arbitrary ( possibly mixed ) initial qubit state . in the commonly employed regime 
 where the qubit dynamics can be described by a markov master equation of lindblad type , we find that for almost all qubit initial states inside the bloch sphere , decoherence is complete while the total state is still separable - no entanglement is involved . in general , both `` separable '' and `` entangling '' decoherence occurs , depending on temperature and initial qubit state . 
 moreover , we find situations where classical and quantum correlations periodically alternate as a function of time in the regime of low temperatures ."
"advances in micro deformable mirror ( dm ) technologies such as mems , have stimulated interest in the characteristics of systems that include a high stroke mirror in series with a high actuator count mirror . 
 this arrangement is referred to as a woofer - tweeter system . in certain situations 
 it may be desirable or necessary to operate the woofer dm in open - loop . 
 we present a simple method for controlling a woofer dm in open loop provided the device behaves in an approximately linear fashion . 
 we have tested a mirror that we believe meets our criterion , the alpao dm52 mirror . using our open - loop method we fit several test kolmogorov wavefronts with the mirror and 
 have achieved an accuracy of approximately 25 @xmath0 @xmath1 surface deviation over the whole clear aperture , and 20 @xmath0 @xmath1 over 90% of the aperture . 
 we have also flattened the mirror in open loop to approximately 11 @xmath0 @xmath1 residual ."
"gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are cosmological explosions which carry valuable information from the distant past of the expanding universe . 
 one of the greatest discoveries in modern cosmology is the finding of the accelerated expansion of the universe using type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) as standard candles . 
 however , due to the interstellar extinction sn ia can be seen only up to a redshift @xmath0 . 
 grbs are considered as the potential alternative to push this limit to as high as @xmath1 , a redshift regime corresponding to an epoch when the universe just started to form the first structures . there 
 exist several correlations between the energy and an observable of a grb which can be used to derive luminosity distance . in recent works 
 , we have studied spectral evolution within the individual pulses and obtained such correlations within the pulses . here 
 we summarize our results of the pulse - wise grb correlation study . 
 it is worth mentioning that all grb correlations are still empirical , and we can not use them in cosmology unless we understand the basic physics of grbs . to this end , we need to investigate the prompt emission spectrum which is so far generally described by the empirical band function . 
 we shall discuss our current understanding of the radiation process particularly the finding of two blackbodies and a powerlaw ( the 2bbpl model ) as the generic spectral model and its implication . 
 this is a work in progress and we expect to obtain the most fundamental grb correlation based on our improved spectral model ."
"rapid uniform rotation of newborn neutron stars ( protoneutron stars ) is studied for a range of internal temperatures and entropies per baryon predicted by the existing numerical simulations . 
 calculations are performed using general relativistic equations of hydrostatic equilibrium of rotating , axially symmetric stars . 
 stability of rotating configurations with respect to mass shedding and the axially symmetric perturbations is studied . 
 numerical calculations are performed for a realistic dense matter equation of state , under various assumptions concerning neutron star interior ( large trapped lepton number , no trapped lepton number , isentropic , isothermal ) . for configurations with baryon mass well below the maximum one for the non - rotating models , the mass shedding limit depends quite sensitively on the position of the `` neutrinosphere '' ( which has a deformed , spheroidal shape ) ; this dependence weakens with increasing baryon mass . 
 the absolute upper limit on rotation frequency is , to a good approximation , obtained for the maximum baryon mass of rotating configurations . 
 empirical formula for the maximum rotation frequency of uniformly rotating protoneutron stars is shown to be quite precise ; it actually coincides with that used for cold neutron stars . 
 evolutionary sequences at fixed baryon mass and angular momentum , which correspond to evolution of protoneutron stars into cold neutron stars are studied , and resulting constraints on the maximum rotation frequency of solitary pulsars are discussed ."
"starting from the pioneering work of g. s. agarwal [ _ zeitschrift fr physik _ * 252 * , 25 ( 1972 ) ] , we present a unified derivation of a number of modified fluctuation - dissipation relations ( mfdr ) that relate response to small perturbations around non - equilibrium steady states to steady - state correlations . using this formalism 
 we show the equivalence of velocity forms of mfdr derived using _ 
 continuum _ 
 langevin and _ discrete _ master equation dynamics . 
 the resulting additive correction to the einstein relation is exemplified using a flashing ratchet model of molecular motors .

"the polarization measure is the probability that among 3 individuals chosen at random from a finite population exactly 2 come from the same class . 
 this index is maximum at the midpoints of the edges of the probability simplex . 
 we compute the gradient flow of this index that is the differential equation whose solutions are the curves of steepest ascent . 
 tools from information geometry are extensively used . in a time series 
 , a comparison of the estimated velocity of variation with the direction of the gradient field should be a better index than the simple variation of the index ."
"in this article , we develop a general method for constructing wavelets @xmath0 on irregular lattices of the form @xmath1 , and with an arbitrary countable family of invertible @xmath2 matrices @xmath3 that do not necessarily have a group structure . this wavelet construction is a particular case of general atomic frame decompositions of @xmath4 developed in this article , that allow other time frequency decompositions such as non - harmonic gabor frames with non - uniform covering of the euclidean space @xmath5 . 
 possible applications include image and video compression , speech coding , image and digital data transmission , image analysis , estimations and detection , and seismology ."
"we assess the probable redshift ( @xmath0 ) for full reionization of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) using a prescription for the co - moving star - formation - rate ( sfr ) density ( @xmath1 ) required to maintain photoionization against recombination . 
 our newly developed on - line reionization simulator allows users to assess the required sfr and ionization histories , using a variety of assumptions for galactic and stellar populations , igm clumping factor and temperature , and lyc escape fraction . 
 the decline in high - redshift galaxy candidates and ly@xmath2  emitters at @xmath3 suggests a rising neutral fraction , with reionization at @xmath4 increasingly difficult owing to increased recombination rates and constraints from the ionizing background and lyc mean free path . 
 the required rate is @xmath5 ^ 3   ( c_h/3)(0.2/f_{\rm esc } ) t_4^{-0.845}$ ] scaled to fiducial values of clumping factor @xmath6 , escape fraction @xmath7 , electron temperature @xmath8  k , and low - metallicity initial mass functions ( imf ) and stellar atmospheres .

 the critical sfr could be reduced by increasing the minimum stellar mass , invoking a top - heavy imf , or systematically increasing @xmath11 at high @xmath12 . 
 the cmb optical depth , @xmath13 , could be explained by full reionization , producing @xmath14 back to @xmath15 , augmented by @xmath16 in a partially ionized igm at @xmath17 . in this scenario , 
 the strongest 21-cm signal should occur at redshifted frequencies @xmath18 mhz owing to igm heating over an interval @xmath19 from @xmath20 ."
"dimensionality reduction methods are very common in the field of high dimensional data analysis 
 . typically , algorithms for dimensionality reduction are computationally expensive . 
 therefore , their applications for the analysis of massive amounts of data are impractical . 
 for example , repeated computations due to accumulated data are computationally prohibitive . in this paper , an out - of - sample extension scheme , which is used as a complementary method for dimensionality reduction , is presented . 
 we describe an algorithm which performs an out - of - sample extension to newly - arrived data points . 
 unlike other extension algorithms such as nystrm algorithm , the proposed algorithm uses the intrinsic geometry of the data and properties for dimensionality reduction map . 
 we prove that the error of the proposed algorithm is bounded . additionally to the out - of - sample extension , 
 the algorithm provides a degree of the abnormality of any newly - arrived data point ."
"the composite operator formalism is applied to qcd at finite temperature to calculate the masses of scalar and pseudoscalar mesons . in particular the ratio of the sigma mass to the pion mass 
 is an interesting measure of the degree of chiral symmetry breaking at different temperatures . 
 we calculate the temperature @xmath0 at which @xmath1 , above which the sigma partial width into two pions vanishes . 
 we find @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the critical temperature for the chiral phase transition ) , within the full effective potential given by the formalism . 
 we find that an expansion _ a - la _ landau of the effective potential around the critical point in the limit of small quark mass provides for a very good determination of @xmath0 .

"we investigate the current and noise characteristics of a double quantum dot system . 
 the strong correlations induced by the coulomb interaction and the pauli principle create entangled two - electron states and lead to signatures in the transport properties . 
 we show that the interaction parameter @xmath0 , which measures the admixture of the double - occupancy contribution to the singlet state and thus the degree of entanglement , can be directly accessed through the fano factor of super - poissonian shot noise ."
"we describe a new paradox for ideal fluids . 
 it arises in the accretion of an _ ideal _ fluid onto a black hole , where , under suitable boundary conditions , the flow can violate the generalized second law of thermodynamics . 
 the paradox indicates that there is in fact a lower bound to the correlation length of any _ real _ fluid , the value of which is determined by the thermodynamic properties of that fluid . 
 we observe that the universal bound on entropy , itself suggested by the generalized second law , puts a lower bound on the correlation length of any fluid in terms of its specific entropy . with the help of a new , efficient estimate for the viscosity of liquids 
 , we argue that this also means that viscosity is bounded from below in a way reminiscent of the conjectured kovtun - son - starinets lower bound on the ratio of viscosity to entropy density . 
 we conclude that much light may be shed on the kovtun - son - starinets bound by suitable arguments based on the generalized second law ."
"the  nessie "" nebula is a filamentary infrared dark cloud ( irdc ) with a large aspect ratio of over 150:1 ( 1.5@xmath0@xmath1 0.01@xmath0 , or 80 pc @xmath1 0.5 pc at a kinematic distance of 3.1 kpc ) . maps of ( 10)emission , a tracer of dense molecular gas , made with the australia telescope national facility mopra telescope , show an excellent morphological match to the mid - ir extinction . moreover , because the molecular line emission from the entire nebula has the same radial velocity to within @xmath2 , the nebula is a single , coherent cloud and not the chance alignment of multiple unrelated clouds along the line of sight . 
 the nessie nebula contains a number of compact , dense molecular cores which have a characteristic projected spacing of @xmath3 4.5 pc along the filament . 
 the theory of gravitationally bound gaseous cylinders predicts the existence of such cores , which , due to the `` sausage '' or `` varicose '' fluid instability , fragment from the cylinder at a characteristic length scale . 
 if turbulent pressure dominates over thermal pressure in nessie , then the observed core spacing matches theoretical predictions . 
 we speculate that the formation of high - mass stars and massive star clusters arises from the fragmentation of filamentary irdcs caused by the `` sausage '' fluid instability that leads to the formation of massive , dense molecular cores . 
 the filamentary molecular gas clouds often found near high - mass star - forming regions ( e.g. , orion , ngc 6334 , etc . ) 
 may represent a later stage of irdc evolution ."
"theoretical studies of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) in graphene have so far focused on the plausibility and stability of the previously known fqhe states for the interaction matrix elements appropriate for graphene . 
 we consider fqhe for su(4 ) symmetry , as appropriate for the situation when all four spin and valley landau bands are degenerate , and predict new fqhe states that have no analog in gaas . 
 these result from an essential interplay between the two - fold spin and valley degeneracies at fractions of the form @xmath0 , for @xmath1 . 
 conditions are outlined for the observation of these states and quantum phase transitions between them ; the structure of these states and their excitations is also described ."
"we observed the spiral galaxies m@xmath051  and m@xmath083  at 20@xmath1 spatial resolution with the bolometer array _ 
 aztec _ on the _ jcmt _ in the 1.1@xmath0 mm continuum , recovering the extended emission out to galactocentric radii of more than 12@xmath0kpc in both galaxies . 
 the 1.1@xmath0mm - continuum fluxes are @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with associated gas masses estimated at @xmath4 and @xmath5 for m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 , respectively . in the interarm regions of both galaxies the @xmath6 ( or x - 
 factor ) ratios exceed those in the arms by factors of @xmath7 - 2 . in the inner disks of both galaxies , 
 the x - factor is about @xmath8 . in the outer parts , 
 the co - dark molecular gas becomes more important . 
 while the spiral density wave in m@xmath051  appears to influence the interstellar medium and stars in a similar way , the bar potential in m@xmath083   influences the interstellar medium and the stars differently . 
 we confirm the result of @xcite that the arms merely heighten the star formation rate and the gas surface density in the same proportion . 
 our maps reveal a threshold gas surface density for an sfr increase by two or more orders of magnitude . in both galaxy centers , 
 the molecular gas depletion time is about 1@xmath0gyr climbing to 10 - 20@xmath0gyr at radii of 6 - 8@xmath0kpc . 
 this is consistent with an inside - out depletion of the molecular gas in the disks of spiral galaxies .

"the closed causal chains arising from backward time travel do not lead to paradoxes if they are self consistent . 
 this raises the question as to how physics ensures that only self - consistent loops are possible . 
 we show that , for one particular case at least , the condition of self consistency is ensured by the interference of quantum mechanical amplitudes associated with the loop . 
 if this can be applied to all loops then we have a mechanism by which inconsistent loops eliminate themselves ."
"the effect of an ac perturbation on the shot noise of a fractional quantum hall fluid is studied both in the weak and the strong backscattering regimes . 
 it is known that the zero - frequency current is linear in the bias voltage , while the noise derivative exhibits steps as a function of bias . 
 in contrast , at laughlin fractions , the backscattering current and the backscattering noise both exhibit evenly spaced singularities , which are reminiscent of the tunneling density of states singularities for quasiparticles . 
 the spacing is determined by the quasiparticle charge @xmath0 and the ratio of the dc bias with respect to the drive frequency . 
 photo 
 assisted transport can thus be considered as a probe for effective charges at such filling factors , and could be used in the study of more complicated fractions of the hall effect . a non - perturbative method for studying photo  assisted transport at @xmath1

"we derive the pairwise peculiar velocity distribution function of dark matter particles applying the dark matter halo approach . unlike the previous work

"a ginzburg - landau model for the macroscopic behaviour of a shape memory alloy is proposed .

 the model relies on a ginzburg - landau free energy defined as a function of macroscopically measurable quantities , and accounts for thermal effects ; couplings between the various relevant physical aspects are established according to thermodynamic consistency . 
 the theoretical model has been implemented within a finite - element framework and a number of numerical tests are presented which investigate the mechanical behaviour of the model under different conditions ; the results obtained are analysed in relation to experimental evidences available in literature .

"we have developed a stellar wind model for ob supergiants to investigate the effects of accretion from a clumpy wind on the luminosity and variability properties of high mass x

 ray light curves in the framework of the bondi - hoyle accretion theory , modified to take into account the presence of clumps . 
 the resulting variability properties are found to depend not only on the assumed orbital parameters but also on the wind characteristics .

"we discuss constraints on the formation of multiple populations in globular clusters ( gcs ) imposed by their present - day kinematics ( velocity dispersion and anisotropy ) and spatial distribution . 
 we argue that the observational evidence collected so far in the outer parts of clusters is generally consistent with an enriched population forming more centrally concentrated compared to the primordial population , in agreement with all the scenarios proposed to date ( in some cases by design ) , but not sufficient to favour a particular scenario . 
 we highlight that the differential rotation of subpopulations is a signature that may provide crucial new constraints and allow us to distinguish between various scenarios . 
 finally , we discuss the spatial distribution of subpopulations in the central regions of gcs and speculate that mass segregation between subpopulations may be due to a difference in their binary fraction ."
"flat density cores have been obtained for a limited number of clusters of galaxies by strong gravitational lensing . using a phenomenological equation of state ( eos ) describing the full - to - partial degeneracy 
 , we integrate the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium . 
 the eos is based on an assumption that the local kinetic energy of a classical particle induced by the gravity dissolves the quantum statistical degeneracy . 
 the density profile is uniquely determined by four parameters , the central density , @xmath0 , the properties of a fermion , namely , the mass , @xmath1 , and statistical weight , @xmath2 , and the ratio of the total matter density and fermion density , @xmath3 . as a case study , we model the column density and 2d encircled mass profiles of a1689 , whose column density profile has been observationally obtained by broadhurst et al . , using gravitational lensing . the column density and 2d encircled profiles at the core , 
 are reasonably reproduced for models with a limited range of particle properties . in the case that previously unknown fermions with spin 1/2 dominate the dark matter , the acceptable particle mass range is between 2 and 4 ev . in the case that the dark matter consists of the mixture of degenerate relic neutrinos and classical collisionless cold dark matter particles 
 , the mass range of neutrinos is between 1 and 2 ev , if the ratio of the two kinds of dark matter particles is fixed to its cosmic value . 
 both the pure fermionic dark matter models and neutrino - cdm - mixture models reproduce the observations equally well ."
"this paper reports positive detections of surface differential rotation on two rapidly rotating cool stars at several epochs , by using stellar surface features ( both cool spots and magnetic regions ) as tracers of the large scale latitudinal shear that distorts the convective envelope in this type of stars . 
 we also report definite evidence that this differential rotation is different when estimated from cool spots or magnetic regions , and that it undergoes temporal fluctuations of potentially large amplitude on a time scale of a few years . 
 we consider these results as further evidence that the dynamo processes operating in these stars are distributed throughout the convective zone rather than being confined at its base as in the sun . by comparing our observations with two very simple models of the differential rotation within the convective zone , we obtain evidence that the internal rotation velocity field of the stars we investigated is not like that of the sun , and may resemble that we expect for rapid rotators . 
 we speculate that the changes in differential rotation result from the dynamo processes ( and from the underlying magnetic cycle ) that periodically converts magnetic energy into kinetic energy and vice versa . 
 we emphasise that the technique outlined in this paper corresponds to the first practical method for investigating the large scale rotation velocity field within convective zones of cool active stars , and offers several advantages over asteroseismology for this particular purpose and this specific stellar class .

"the possibility is considered that turbulence is described by differential equations for which uniqueness fails maximally , at least in some limit . the inviscid burgers equation , in the context of onsager s suggestion that turbulence should be described by a negative absolute temperature , is such a limit . 
 in this picture , the onset of turbulence coincides with the proliferation of singularities which characterizes the failure of uniqueness .

"in the past few years , small scale anisotropy has become a primary focus in the search for source of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) . the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) 
 has reported the presence of clusters of event arrival directions in their highest energy data set . 
 the high resolution fly s eye ( hires ) has accumulated an exposure in one of its monocular eyes at energies above @xmath0  ev comparable to that of agasa . however , monocular events observed with an air fluorescence detector are characterized by highly asymmetric angular resolution . 
 a method is developed for measuring autocorrelation with asymmetric angular resolution . 
 it is concluded that hires - i observations are consistent with no autocorrelation and that the sensitivity to clustering of the hires - i detector is comparable to that of the reported agasa data set . 
 furthermore , we state with a 90% confidence level that no more than 13% of the observed hires - i events above @xmath0  ev could be sharing common arrival directions . however , because a measure of autocorrelation makes no assumption of the underlying astrophysical mechanism that results in clustering phenomena , we can not claim that the hires monocular analysis and the agasa analysis are inconsistent beyond a specified confidence level .    cosmic rays , anisotropy , clustering , autocorrelation , hires , agasa    98.70.sa , 95.55.vj , 96.40.pq , 13.85.tp"
"the thermal and chemical phases of the cool component of interstellar gas are discussed . variations with galactocentric radius and from galaxy to galaxy are mostly the result of changes in the ambient interstellar pressure and radiation field . 
 interstellar structure that is hierarchical or fractal in the cloudy parts and has large and connected empty regions between these clouds is probably the result of turbulence . 
 such structure opens up the disk to the transmission of ob star light into the halo , and it provides for a diffuse ionized component that tapers away gradually from each dense hii region .

"renewable energy powered cognitive radio ( cr ) network has gained much attention due to its combination of the cr s spectrum efficiency and the renewable energy s greennature . in the paper 
 , we investigate the delay - optimal data transmission in the renewable energy aided cr networks . 
 specifically , a primary user ( pu ) and a secondary user ( su ) share the same frequency in an area . 
 the su s interference to the pu is controlled by interference - signal - ratio ( isr ) constraint , which means that the isr at the pu receiver ( rx ) should be less than a threshold . under this constraint , 
 the renewable energy powered su aims to minimize the average data buffer delay by scheduling the renewable allocations in each slot . 
 a constrained stochastic optimization problem is formulated when the randomness of the renewable arrival , the uncertainty of the su s data generation , and the variability of the fading channel are taken into account . by analyzing the formulated problem , we propose two practical algorithms that is optimal for two special scenarios . and

"perhaps the most compelling evidence for the role of magnetic reconnection in solar flares comes from the supra - arcade downflows that have been observed above many post - flare loop arcades . 
 these downflows are thought to be related to highly non - potential field lines that have reconnected and are propagating away from the current sheet . 
 we present new observations of supra - arcade downflows taken with the atmospheric imagining assembly ( aia ) on the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( _ sdo _ ) . 
 the morphology and dynamics of the downflows observed with aia provide new evidence for the role of magnetic reconnection in solar flares . with these new observations we are able to measure downflows originating at much larger heights than in previous studies . 
 we find , however , that the initial velocities measured here ( @xmath0144 km  s@xmath1 ) are well below the alfvn speed expected in the lower corona , and consistent with previous results . 
 we also find no evidence that the downflows brighten with time , as would be expected from chromospheric evaporation . 
 these observations suggest that simple two - dimensional models can not explain the detailed observations of solar flares ."
"using a metric perturbation method , we study gravitational waves from a test particle scattered by a spherically symmetric relativistic star . 
 we calculate the energy spectrum and the waveform of gravitational waves for axial modes . 
 since metric perturbations in axial modes do not couple to the matter fluid of the star , emitted waves for a normal neutron star show only one peak in the spectrum , which corresponds to the orbital frequency at the turning point , where the gravitational field is strongest . 
 however , for an ultracompact star ( the radius @xmath0 ) , another type of resonant periodic peak appears in the spectrum . 
 this is just because of an excitation by a scattered particle of axial quasinormal modes , which were found by chandrasekhar and ferrari . 
 this excitation comes from the existence of the potential minimum inside of a star . 
 we also find for an ultracompact star many small periodic peaks at the frequency region beyond the maximum of the potential , which would be due to a resonance of two waves reflected by two potential barriers ( regge - wheeler type and one at the center of the star ) . such resonant peaks appear neither for a normal neutron star nor for a schwarzschild black hole . 
 consequently , even if we analyze the energy spectrum of gravitational waves only for axial modes , it would be possible to distinguish between an ultracompact star and a normal neutron star ( or a schwarzschild black hole ) .

"most of us must have been fascinated by the eye catching displays of collectively moving animals . 
 schools of fish can move in a rather orderly fashion and then change direction amazingly abruptly . 
 there are a huge number of further examples both from the living and the non - living world for phenomena during which the many interacting , permanently moving units seem to arrive at a common behavioural pattern taking place in a short time . as a paradigm of this type of phenomena we consider the problem of how birds arrive at a decision resulting in their synchronized landing . 
 we introduce a simple model to interpret this process . 
 collective motion prior to landing is modelled using a simple self - propelled particle ( spp ) system with a new kind of boundary condition , while the tendency and the sudden propagation of the intention of landing is introduced through rules analogous to the random field ising model in an external field . 
 we show that our approach is capable of capturing the most relevant features of collective decision making in a system of units with a variance of individual intentions and being under an increasing level of pressure to switch states . 
 we find that  as a function of the few parameters of our model 
 the collective switching from the flying to the landing state is indeed much sharper than the distribution of the individual landing intentions .

"we experimentally study the velocity scaling of granular convection which is a possible mechanism of the regolith migration on the surface of small asteroids . in order to evaluate the contribution of granular convection to the regolith migration 
 , the velocity of granular convection under the microgravity condition has to be revealed . 
 although it is hard to control the gravitational acceleration in laboratory experiments , scaling relations involving the gravitational effect can be evaluated by systematic experiments . 
 therefore , we perform such a systematic experiment of the vibration - induced granular convection . from the experimental data , a scaling form for the granular convective velocity is obtained . 
 the obtained scaling form implies that the granular convective velocity can be decomposed into two characteristic velocity components : vibrational and gravitational velocities . 
 in addition , the system size dependence is also scaled . according to the scaling form , the granular convective velocity @xmath0 depends on the gravitational acceleration @xmath1 as @xmath2 when the normalized vibrational acceleration is fixed .

"erupting filaments are sometimes observed to undergo a rotation about the vertical direction as they rise . 
 this rotation of the filament axis is generally interpreted as a conversion of twist into writhe in a kink - unstable magnetic flux rope . 
 consistent with this interpretation , the rotation is usually found to be clockwise ( as viewed from above ) if the post - eruption arcade has right - handed helicity , but counterclockwise if it has left - handed helicity . here 
 , we describe two non  active - region filament events recorded with the extreme - ultraviolet imaging telescope ( eit ) on the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( _ soho _ ) , in which the sense of rotation appears to be opposite to that expected from the helicity of the post - event arcade . based on these observations 
 , we suggest that the rotation of the filament axis is in general determined by the net helicity of the erupting system , and that the axially aligned core of the filament can have the opposite helicity sign to the surrounding field . in most cases , 
 the surrounding field provides the main contribution to the net helicity . in the events reported here , 
 however , the helicity associated with the filament `` barbs '' is opposite in sign to and dominates that of the overlying arcade ."

 our results show a quite strong @xmath4-@xmath4 interaction between tpp and the cnt surface , with binding energies ranging from 1.1 to 1.8  ev , where higher energies can be associated with increasing cnt diameters .

 results for the tpp physisorption on graphene show a remarkable stability with binding energy of 3.2  ev , inducing a small redshift on the @xmath4-stacked tpp absorption bands . 
 the strong graphene - tpp interaction also induces a charge transfer from tpp to graphene , indicating a @xmath0-type doping mechanism without compromising the graphene structure ."
"in vivo calcium imaging through microscopes has enabled deep brain imaging of previously inaccessible neuronal populations within the brains of freely moving subjects . 
 however , microendoscopic data suffer from high levels of background fluorescence as well as an increased potential for overlapping neuronal signals . 
 previous methods fail in identifying neurons and demixing their temporal activity because the cellular signals are often submerged in the large fluctuating background . here 
 we develop an efficient method to extract cellular signals with minimal influence from the background . 
 we model the background with two realistic components : ( 1 ) one models the constant baseline and slow trends of each pixel , and ( 2 ) the other models the fast fluctuations from out - of - focus signals and is therefore constrained to have low spatial - frequency structure . 
 this decomposition avoids cellular signals being absorbed into the background term . after subtracting the background approximated with this model , we use constrained nonnegative matrix factorization ( cnmf , @xcite ) to better demix neural signals and get their denoised and deconvolved temporal activity . 
 we validate our method on simulated and experimental data , where it shows fast , reliable , and high quality signal extraction under a wide variety of imaging parameters ."

 it hosts two prominent radio galaxies with powers in the range critical for radio - mode feedback . 
 the radio emission from these galaxies terminates in buoyant tendrils reaching the cluster s outer edge , and the radio - emitting plasma clearly influences the cluster s x - ray - emitting atmosphere . 
 the cluster s average gas temperature , of @xmath0 kev , is high for its bolometric luminosity of 3.2 @xmath1 ergs s@xmath2 , but the 100 kpc - scale cavity carved out by radio - emitting plasma shows evidence of less than 2 per cent of the excess enthalpy .

 we see no evidence for shocks , or established isobaric gas motions ( sloshing ) , but there is much sub - structure associated with a dynamically active central region that encompasses the brightest radio emission . 
 gas heating is evident in directions perpendicular to the inferred line of encounter between the infalling group and cluster . 
 the radio - emitting tendrils run along boundaries between gas of different temperature , apparently lubricating the gas flows and inhibiting heat transfer .

 tunnel barriers reduce the slope of the @xmath1 scaling in the case of the electrical current , while leaving the thermal current unaffected ."
"we consider clean cylindrical nanostructures with an applied longitudinal static magnetic field . without coulomb interaction , the field induces , for particular values , points of degeneracy where a change of ground state takes place due to aharonov - bohm effect . 
 the coulomb potential introduces interaction between the electronic configurations . as a consequence , 
 when there is degeneracy , the ground state of the system becomes a many body state - unable to be described by a mean - field theory - and a gap is opened . to study this problem 
 , we propose a variational multireference wave function which goes beyond the hartree - fock approximation . 
 using this ansatz , in addition to the avoided crossing formation , two other effects of the electron - electron interaction are pointed out : ( i ) the long - range part of the coulomb potential tends to shift the position in magnetic field of the ( avoided ) crossing points and , ( ii ) at the points of ( near ) degeneracy , the interaction can drive the system from a singlet to a triplet state inducing new real crossing points in the ground state energy curve as function of the field . 
 such crossings should appear in various experiments as sudden changes in the response of the system ( magnetoconductance , magnetopolarisability , ... ) when the magnetic field is tuned ."

 the calculations give the decay width @xmath3 for chernyak - zhitnitsky - type(cz - type ) current and @xmath4 for ioffe - type current . 
 the ioffe - type interpolating current is found to be better for the estimation of the decay rate from a comparison with experimental data ."
"starting from a microscopic model , we investigate the optical spectra of molecules in strongly - coupled organic microcavities examining how they might self - consistently adapt their coupling to light . 
 we consider both rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom , focusing on features which can be seen in the peak in the center of the spectrum at the bare excitonic frequency . in both cases 
 we find that the matter - light coupling can lead to a self - consistent change of the molecular states , with consequent temperature - dependent signatures in the absorption spectrum . 
 however , for typical parameters , these effects are much too weak to explain recent measurements . 
 we show that another mechanism which naturally arises from our model of vibrationally dressed polaritons has the right magnitude and temperature dependence to be at the origin of the observed data ."

"we present the results of differential proper - motion analyses of the egg nebula ( rafgl 2688 , v1610 cyg ) based on the archived two - epoch optical data taken with the hubble space telescope . 
 first , we determined that the polarization characteristics of the is influenced by the higher optical depth of the central regions of the nebula ( i.e. , the `` dustsphere '' of @xmath0 au radius ) , causing the nebula illuminated in two steps  the direct starlight is first channeled into bipolar cavities and then scattered off to the rest of the nebula . 
 we then measured the amount of motion of local structures and the signature concentric arcs by determining their relative shifts over the 7.25-yr interval . based on our analysis , which does not rely on the single - scattering assumption 
 , we concluded that the lobes have been excavated by a linear expansion along the bipolar axis for the past @xmath1  yr , while the concentric arcs have been generated continuously and moving out radially at about 10  km  s@xmath2 for the past @xmath3  yr , and there appears to be a colatitudinally - increasing trend in the radial expansion velocity field of the concentric arcs . 
 there exist numerical investigations into the mass - loss modulation by the central binary system , which predict such a colatitudinally - increasing expansion velocity field in the spiral - shock trails of the mass - loss ejecta . 
 therefore , the egg nebula may represent a rare edge - on case of the binary - modulated circumstellar environs , corroborating the previous theoretical predictions ."
"we consider continuous - wave ( cw ) states and dark solitons ( dss ) in a system of two fundamental - frequency ( ff ) and one second - harmonic ( sh ) waves in a planar waveguide with the quadratic [ @xmath0 nonlinearity , the ff components being linearly coupled by resonant reflections on the bragg grating ( the same model is known to support a great variety of bright solitons ) . 
 we demonstrate that , in contrast with the usual situation in spatial - domain @xmath1 models , cw states with the phase shift @xmath2 between the ff and sh components are modulationally _ stable _ in a broad parameter region in this system , provided that the cw wavenumber does not belong to the system s spectral gap . 
 stationary fundamental dss are found numerically , and are also constructed by means of a specially devised analytical approximation . 
 bound states of two and three dss are found too . 
 the fundamental dss and two - solitons bound states are _ stable _ in all the cases when the cw background is stable , which is shown by dint of calculation of the corresponding eigenvalues , and verified in direct simulations . 
 tilted dss are found too . 
 they attain a maximum contrast at a finite value of the tilt , that does not depend on the @xmath1 phase mismatch . at a maximum value of the tilt , which  grows with the mismatch , the ds merges into the cw background .

"the interaction of compact objects with an infinitely extended mirror plane due to quantum fluctuations of a scalar or electromagnetic field that scatters off the objects is studied . 
 the mirror plane is assumed to obey either dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions or to be perfectly reflecting . using the method of images , we generalize a recently developed approach for compact objects in unbounded space @xcite to show that the casimir interaction between the objects and the mirror plane can be accurately obtained over a wide range of separations in terms of charge and current fluctuations of the objects and their images . 
 our general result for the interaction depends only on the scattering matrices of the compact objects . 
 it applies to scalar fields with arbitrary boundary conditions and to the electromagnetic field coupled to dielectric objects . for the experimentally important electromagnetic casimir interaction between a perfectly conducting sphere and a plane mirror we present the first results that apply at all separations . 
 we obtain both an asymptotic large distance expansion and the two lowest order correction terms to the proximity force approximation . 
 the asymptotic casimir - polder potential for an atom and a mirror is generalized to describe the interaction between a dielectric sphere and a mirror , involving higher order multipole polarizabilities that are important at sub - asymptotic distances ."

"light curve analysis of decay phase of nova outburst are summarized . 
 nova duration is determined by the strong wind mass - loss which depends only on the white dwarf mass . 
 fast novae correspond very massive white dwarfs and very slow novae correspond almost lower mass limit of white dwarfs . 
 this relation is shown in both of classical novae and recurrent novae .

"the emission from young stellar objects ( ysos ) in the mid - ir is dominated by the inner rim of their circumstellar disks . 
 we present an ir - monitoring survey of @xmath0 objects in the direction of the lynds 1688 ( l1688 ) star forming region over four visibility windows spanning 1.6  years using the _ spitzer _ space telescope in its warm mission phase . among all lightcurves , 
 57 sources are cluster members identified based on their spectral - energy distribution and x - ray emission . 
 almost all cluster members show significant variability . the amplitude of the variability is larger in more embedded ysos . 
 ten out of 57 cluster members have periodic variations in the lightcurves with periods typically between three and seven days , but even for those sources , significant variability in addition to the periodic signal can be seen . 
 no period is stable over 1.6  years . 
 non - periodic lightcurves often still show a preferred timescale of variability which is longer for more embedded sources . about half of all sources exhibit redder colors in a fainter state . 
 this is compatible with time - variable absorption towards the yso . 
 the other half becomes bluer when fainter . 
 these colors can only be explained with significant changes in the structure of the inner disk . 
 no relation between mid - ir variability and stellar effective temperature or x - ray spectrum is found ."

"we study the motion of magnetic skyrmions in a nanowire induced by a spin - wave current @xmath0 flowing out of a driving layer close to the edge of the wire . by applying micromagnetic simulation and an analysis of the effective thiele equation 
 , we find that the skyrmion trajectory is governed by an interplay of both forces due to the magnon current and the wire boundary . 
 the skyrmion is attracted to the driving layer and is accelerated by the repulsive force due to the wire boundary . 
 we consider both cases of a driving longitudinal and transverse to the nanowire , but a steady - state motion of the skyrmion is only obtained for a transverse magnon current . for the latter case , we find in the limit of low current densities @xmath0 the velocity - current relation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the skyrmion velocity and @xmath3 is the gilbert damping . for large @xmath0 in case of strong driving , the skyrmion is pushed into the driving layer resulting in a drop of the skyrmion velocity and , eventually , the destruction of the skyrmion ."
"micro - blogging systems such as twitter expose digital traces of social discourse with an unprecedented degree of resolution of individual behaviors . 
 they offer an opportunity to investigate how a large - scale social system responds to exogenous or endogenous stimuli , and to disentangle the temporal , spatial and topical aspects of users activity . here 
 we focus on spikes of collective attention in twitter , and specifically on peaks in the popularity of hashtags . 
 users employ hashtags as a form of social annotation , to define a shared context for a specific event , topic , or meme . 
 we analyze a large - scale record of twitter activity and find that the evolution of hashtag popularity over time defines discrete classes of hashtags . 
 we link these dynamical classes to the events the hashtags represent and use text mining techniques to provide a semantic characterization of the hashtag classes . 
 moreover , we track the propagation of hashtags in the twitter social network and find that epidemic spreading plays a minor role in hashtag popularity , which is mostly driven by exogenous factors .

"the compressibility of molecular cloud ( mc ) turbulence plays a crucial role in star formation models , because it controls the amplitude and distribution of density fluctuations . 
 the relation between the compressive ratio ( the ratio of powers in compressive and solenoidal motions ) and the statistics of turbulence has been previously studied systematically only in idealized simulations with random external forces . in this work , 
 we analyze a simulation of large - scale turbulence ( 250 pc ) driven by supernova ( sn ) explosions that has been shown to yield realistic mc properties . 
 we demonstrate that sn driving results in mc turbulence with a broad lognormal distribution of the compressive ratio , with a mean value @xmath0 , lower than the equilibrium value of @xmath1 found in the inertial range of isothermal simulations with random solenoidal driving . 
 we also find that the compressibility of the turbulence is not noticeably affected by gravity , nor are the mean cloud radial ( expansion or contraction ) and solid - body rotation velocities . 
 furthermore , the clouds follow a general relation between the rms density and the rms mach number similar to that of supersonic isothermal turbulence , though with a large scatter , and their average gas density pdf is described well by a lognormal distribution , with the addition of a high - density power - law tail when self - gravity is included ."
"* we introduce a `` hamiltonian''-like function , called the volume function , indispensable to describe the ensemble of jammed matter such as granular materials and emulsions from a geometrical point of view . 
 the volume function represents the available volume of each particle in the jammed systems . at the microscopic level , we show that the volume function is the voronoi volume associated to each particle and in turn we provide an analytical formula for the voronoi volume in terms of the contact network , valid for any dimension . 
 we then develop a statistical theory for the probability distribution of the volumes in 3d to calculate an average volume function coarse - grained at a mesoscopic level . 
 the salient result is the discovery of a mesoscopic volume function inversely proportional to the coordination number . 
 our analysis is the first step toward the calculation of macroscopic observables and equations of state using the statistical mechanics of jammed matter , when supplemented by the condition of mechanical equilibrium of jamming that properly defines jammed matter at the ensemble level . *"

 second , allowing small transients does not destroy the important asymptotic properties of contractive systems .

"it is suggested that m31 was created by the early merger , and subsequent violent relaxation , of two or more massive metal - rich ancestral galaxies within the core of the andromeda subgroup of the local group . on the other hand the evolution of the main body of the galaxy appears to have been dominated by the collapse of a single ancestral object , that subsequently evolved by capturing a halo of small metal - poor companions . 
 it remains a mystery why the globular cluster systems surrounding galaxies like m33 and the lmc exhibit such striking differences in evolutionary history . 
 it is argued that the first generation of globular clusters might have been formed nearly simultaneously in all environments by the strong pressure increase that accompanied cosmic reionization . on the other hand subsequent generations of globulars 
 may have formed during starbursts that were triggered by collisions and mergers of gas rich galaxies .    _ the fact that the [ g]alactic system is a member of a group is a very fortunate accident . _ hubble ( 1936 , p.125 )"
"using the dynamical triangulation approach we perform a numerical study of a supersymmetric random surface model that corresponds to the large @xmath0 limit of the four  dimensional version of the ikkt matrix model .

 numerical sampling of the configurations in the tail of the distribution shows that the bosonic degrees of freedom collapse to a one  dimensional tube with small transverse fluctuations . assuming that the vertex positions can fluctuate independently within the tube

 disorder effects show large variation depending on the properly quantified strength of disorder , leading either to non - monotonic effective interaction with both repulsive and attractive branches when the surface charges are weakly disordered ( small disorder variance ) or to a dominating attractive interaction that is larger both in its range and magnitude than what is predicted from the van der waals and image - induced , ion - depletion interactions , when the surfaces are strongly disordered ( large disorder variance ) ."

 we calculate the expected signal from these outflows ( our calculations are also applicable to short grb orphan afterglows ) and we discuss their detectability . 
 we show that the optimal search for such signal should , conveniently , take place around 1.4 ghz . 
 realistic estimates of the outflow parameters yield signals of a few hundred @xmath0jy , lasting a few weeks , from sources at the detection horizon of advanced gw detectors . 
 followup radio observations , triggered by gw detection , could reveal the radio remnant even under unfavorable conditions . 
 upcoming all sky surveys can detect a few dozen , and possibly even thousands , merger remnants at any give time , thereby providing robust merger rate estimates even before the advanced gw detectors become operational . 
 in fact , the radio transient rt 19870422 fits well the overall properties predicted by our model and we suggest that its most probable origin is a compact binary merger radio remnant ."
"sparse - to - dense interpolation for optical flow is a fundamental phase in the pipeline of most of the leading optical flow estimation algorithms . 
 the current state - of - the - art method for interpolation , epicflow , is a local average method based on an edge aware geodesic distance . 
 we propose a new data - driven sparse - to - dense interpolation algorithm based on a fully convolutional network . 
 we draw inspiration from the filling - in process in the visual cortex and introduce lateral dependencies between neurons and multi - layer supervision into our learning process . 
 we also show the importance of the image contour to the learning process . 
 our method is robust and outperforms epicflow on competitive optical flow benchmarks with several underlying matching algorithms . 
 this leads to state - of - the - art performance on the sintel and kitti 2012 benchmarks ."
"we present a new approach to calculate the attractive long range vortex - vortex interaction of the van der waals type present in anisotropic and layered superconductors . 
 the mapping of the statistical mechanics of vortex lines onto the imaginary time quantum mechanics of two dimensional charged bosons allows us to define a 2d casimir problem : two half - spaces of ( dilute ) vortex matter separated by a gap of width @xmath0 are mapped to two dielectric half - planes of charged bosons interacting via a massive gauge field . 
 we determine the attractive casimir force between the two half - planes and show , that it agrees with the pairwise summation of the van der waals force between vortices previously found by blatter and geshkenbein [ phys .

"we show that quadratic divergences in top - quark condensation are cancelled when the tadpoles cancel . 
 this latter cancellation is naturally implemented as the cancellation among the top - quark , goldstone and higgs contributions . 
 we also calculate the bosonic correction terms to gribov s mass formula for the higgs boson . 
 these reduce the prediction for @xmath0 from @xmath1  gev to @xmath2  gev . 
 the tadpole cancellation condition by itself is an independent condition on the mass of the higgs boson which , in gribov s u(1)@xmath3 scenario , yields @xmath4  gev with large theoretical uncertainty . 
 more generally , we are able to obtain all three masses , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath0 , in @xmath7  mev to @xmath8  tev energy range as a function of the cut - off scale and the gauge couplings only ."
"we investigate numerically the hydrodynamic instability of an ionization front ( if ) accelerating into a molecular cloud , with imposed initial perturbations of different amplitudes . 
 when the initial amplitude is small , the imposed perturbation is completely stabilized and does not grow . 
 when the initial perturbation amplitude is large enough , roughly the ratio of the initial amplitude to wavelength is greater than 0.02 , portions of the if temporarily separate from the molecular cloud surface , locally decreasing the ablation pressure . 
 this causes the appearance of a large , warm hi region and triggers nonlinear dynamics of the if . 
 the local difference of the ablation pressure and acceleration enhances the appearance and growth of a multimode perturbation . 
 the stabilization usually seen at the if in the linear regimes does not work due to the mismatch of the modes of the perturbations at the cloud surface and in density in hii region above the cloud surface . 
 molecular pillars are observed in the late stages of the large amplitude perturbation case . 
 the velocity gradient in the pillars is in reasonably good agreement with that observed in the eagle nebula . 
 the initial perturbation is imposed in three different ways : in density , in incident photon number flux , and in the surface shape . 
 all cases show both stabilization for a small initial perturbation and large growth of the second harmonic by increasing amplitude of the initial perturbation above a critical value ."
"we study the connection between the cumulants of a time - integrated observable of a quantum system and the @xmath0-symmetry properties of the non - hermitian deformation of the hamiltonian from which the generating function of these cumulants is obtained . 
 this non - hermitian hamiltonian can display regimes of broken and of unbroken @xmath0-symmetry , depending on the parameters of the problem and on the counting field that sets the strength of the non - hermitian perturbation . 
 this in turn determines the analytic structure of the long - time cumulant generating function ( cgf ) for the time - integrated observable . 
 we consider in particular the case of the time - integrated ( longitudinal ) magnetisation in the one - dimensional ising model in a transverse field . 
 we show that its long - time cgf is singular on a curve in the magnetic field / counting field plane that delimits a regime where @xmath0-symmetry is spontaneously broken ( which includes the static ferromagnetic phase ) , from one where it is preserved ( which includes the static paramagnetic phase ) . in the paramagnetic phase , conservation of @xmath0-symmetry 
 implies that all cumulants are sub - linear in time , a behaviour usually associated to the absence of decorrelation ."
"we report the detection and observed characteristics of giant pulses from the crab nebula pulsar ( b0531 + 21 ) in four frequency bands covering 2084  mhz using the recently - completed long wavelength array station  1 ( lwa1 ) radio telescope . in 10  hours of observations distributed over a 72  day period in fall of 2012

 twenty - two of these pulses were detected simultaneously in channels of 16 mhz bandwidth centered at 44  mhz , 60  mhz , and 76  mhz , including one pulse which was also detected in a channel centered at 28  mhz . 
 we quantify statistics of pulse amplitude and pulse shape characteristics , including pulse broadening .

"we study eigenmodes of acoustic oscillations of high multipolarity @xmath0  @xmath1 and high frequency ( @xmath2 khz ) , localized in neutron star envelopes .

 once the oscillation spectrum is calculated for a given equation of state ( eos ) in the envelope and given stellar mass @xmath3 and radius @xmath4 , it can be rescaled to a star with any @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( but the same eos in the envelope ) . 
 for @xmath5 the modes can be subdivided into the outer and inner ones . 
 the outer modes are mainly localized in the outer envelope . 
 the inner modes are mostly localized near the neutron drip point , being associated with the softening of the eos after the neutron drip . 
 we calculate oscillation spectra for the eoss of cold - catalyzed and accreted matter and show that the spectra of the inner modes are essentially different . 
 a detection and identification of high - frequency pressure modes would allow one to infer @xmath3 and @xmath4 and determine also the eos in the envelope ( accreted or ground - state ) providing thus a new and simple method to explore the main parameters and internal structure of neutron stars .

 this amplitude coincides with the value of the dipole temperature anisotropy @xmath1 of the cmbr obtained by cobe .

"we report the detection of molecular clouds around the x - ray bright interior feature in the galactic supernova remnant ( snr ) ctb  109  ( g109.11.0 ) . 
 this feature , called the lobe , has been previously suggested to be the result of an interaction of the snr shock wave with a molecular cloud complex . 
 we present new high resolution x - ray data from the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory and new high resolution co data from the five college radio observatory which show the interaction region with the cloud complex in greater detail . 
 the co data reveal three clouds around the lobe in the velocity interval @xmath0 . 
 the velocity profiles of @xmath1co at various parts of the east cloud are well fit with a gaussian ; however , at the position where the co cloud and the lobe overlap , the velocity profile has an additional component towards higher negative velocities . 
 the molecular hydrogen density in this part of the cloud is relatively high (  @xmath2  @xmath3 ) , whereas the foreground absorption in x - rays (  @xmath4  @xmath3 ) , obtained from _ chandra _

"bars in gas - rich spiral galaxies are short - lived . 
 they drive gas inflows through their gravity torques , and at the same time self - regulate their strength . 
 their robustness has been subject of debate , since it was thought that only the resulting central mass concentrations ( cmcs ) were weakening bars , and only relatively rare massive cmcs were able to completely destroy them . through numerical simulations including gas dynamics 
 , we find that with the gas parameters of normal spiral galaxies , the cmc is not sufficient to fully dissolve the bar . but 
 another overlooked mechanism , the transfer of angular momentum from the infalling gas to the stellar bar , can also strongly weaken the bar . in addition , we show that gravity torques are correctly reproduced in simulations , and conclude that bars are transient features , with life - time of 1 - 2 gyr in typical sb - sc galaxies , because of the combined effects of cmcs and gravity torques , while most existing works had focussed on the cmc effects alone .

"binary quantum information can be fault tolerantly encoded in states defined in infinite dimensional hilbert spaces . 
 such states define a computational basis , and permit a perfect equivalence between continuous and discrete universal operations . 
 the drawback of this encoding is that the corresponding logical states are unphysical , meaning infinitely localized in phase space . 
 we use the modular variables formalism to show that , in a number of protocols relevant for quantum information and for the realization of fundamental tests of quantum mechanics , it is possible to loosen the requirements on the logical subspace without jeopardizing their usefulness or their successful implementation . 
 such protocols involve measurements of appropriately chosen modular variables that permit the readout of the encoded discrete quantum information from the corresponding logical states .

"velocity errors in particle tracking velocimetry ( ptv ) are studied . 
 when using high - speed video cameras , the velocity error may increase at a high camera frame rate . 
 this increase in velocity error is due to particle - position uncertainty , which is one of two sources of velocity errors studied here . 
 the other source of error is particle acceleration , which has the opposite trend of diminishing at higher frame rates . both kinds of errors can propagate into quantities calculated from velocity , such as the kinetic temperature of particles or correlation functions . as demonstrated in a dusty plasma experiment 
 , the kinetic temperature of particles has no unique value when measured using ptv , but depends on the sampling time interval or frame rate . 
 it is also shown that an artifact appears in an autocorrelation function computed from particle positions and velocities , and it becomes more severe when a small sampling - time interval is used .

"x - ray emitting clusters of galaxies are considered in the context of modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) . 
 i show that self - gravitating isothermal gas spheres are not good representations of rich clusters with respect to the radial gas density distribution as indicated by the x - ray surface brightness . 
 pure gas spheres with a density distribution described by a @xmath0 model , as observed , also fail because , with mond , these objects are far from isothermal and have a gas mass and luminosity much larger than observed for clusters of the same mean temperature . 
 these problems may be resolved by adding an additional dark mass component in the central regions ; a constant density sphere contained within two core radii and having a total mass of one to two times that in the gas . with this additional component , 
 the observed luminosity - temperature relation for clusters of galaxies is reproduced . 
 when the observed x - ray surface brightness distribution in actual clusters is modeled by such a two - component structure , the typical mass discrepancy is three to four times smaller than with newtonian dynamics . 
 thus while mond significantly reduces the mass of the dark component in clusters it does not remove it completely . 
 i speculate on the nature of the dark component and argue that this is not a fundamental problem for mond .

"there have been attempts to fit the abundance patterns of extremely metal - poor stars with supernova nucleosynthesis models for the lighter elements than zn . on the other hand

 the 621  ghz water line emission shows clear evidence for strong maser amplication in all three sources , exhibiting narrow ( @xmath4 km / s fwhm ) emission features that are coincident ( kinematically and/or spatially ) with observed 22  ghz features . 
 moreover , in the case of w49n  for which observations were available at three epochs spanning a two year period  the spectra exhibited variability . 
 the observed 621  ghz/22  ghz line ratios are consistent with a maser pumping model in which the population inversions arise from the combined effects of collisional excitation and spontaneous radiative decay , and the inferred physical conditions can plausibly arise in gas heated by either dissociative or non - dissociative shocks . 
 the collisional excitation model also predicts that the 22  ghz population inversion will be quenched at higher densities than that of the 621  ghz transition , providing a natural explanation for the observational fact that 22  ghz maser emission appears to be a necessary but insufficient condition for 621  ghz maser emission ."

"in a recent contribution , @xcite investigated the incidence of planar alignments of satellite galaxies in the millennium - ii simulation , and concluded that vast thin planes of dwarf galaxies , similar to that observed in the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) , occur frequently by chance in @xmath0-cold dark matter cosmology 
 . however , their analysis did not capture the essential fact that the observed alignment is simultaneously radially extended , yet thin , and kinematically unusual . with the caveat that the millennium - ii simulation may not have sufficient mass resolution to identify confidently simulacra of low - luminosity dwarf galaxies , we re - examine that simulation for planar structures , using the same method as employed by ibata et al . 
 ( 2013 ) on the real m31 satellites .

 we further investigate the angular momentum properties of the co - planar satellites , and find that the median of the specific angular momentum derived from the line of sight velocities in the real m31 structure ( @xmath1 ) is very high compared to systems drawn from the simulations . 
 this analysis confirms that it is highly unlikely that the observed structure around the andromeda galaxy is due to a chance occurrence .

"an important problem in econometrics and marketing is to infer the causal impact that a designed market intervention has exerted on an outcome metric over time . 
 this paper proposes to infer causal impact on the basis of a diffusion - regression state - space model that predicts the counterfactual market response in a synthetic control that would have occurred had no intervention taken place . 
 in contrast to classical difference - in - differences schemes , state - space models make it possible to ( i ) infer the temporal evolution of attributable impact , ( ii ) incorporate empirical priors on the parameters in a fully bayesian treatment , and ( iii ) flexibly accommodate multiple sources of variation , including local trends , seasonality and the time - varying influence of contemporaneous covariates . using a markov chain monte carlo algorithm for posterior inference , we illustrate the statistical properties of our approach on simulated data . 
 we then demonstrate its practical utility by estimating the causal effect of an online advertising campaign on search - related site visits .

"we consider the @xmath0=1 friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) model within loop quantum cosmology , paying special attention to the existence of an ambiguity in the quantization process . in 
 spatially non - flat anisotropic models such as bianchi ii and ix , the standard method of defining the curvature through closed holonomies is not admissible .

 these two quantization methods coincide , but in the case of the closed @xmath0=1 frw model they might yield different quantum theories . in this manuscript 
 we explore these two quantizations and the different effective descriptions they provide of the bouncing cyclic universe . 
 in particular , as we show in detail , the most dramatic difference is that in the theory defined by the new quantization method , there is not one , but _ two _ different bounces through which the cyclic universe alternates . 
 we show that for a ` large ' universe , these two bounces are very similar and , therefore , practically indistinguishable , approaching the dynamics of the holonomy based quantum theory ."

"in this review we describe a non - trivial relationship between perturbative gauge theory and gravity scattering amplitudes . at the semi - classical or tree level 
 , the scattering amplitudes of gravity theories in flat space can be expressed as a sum of products of well defined pieces of gauge theory amplitudes . 
 these relationships were first discovered by kawai , lewellen , and tye in the context of string theory , but hold more generally . in particular , they hold for standard einstein gravity . a method based on @xmath0-dimensional unitarity 
 can then be used to systematically construct all quantum loop corrections order - by - order in perturbation theory using as input the gravity tree amplitudes expressed in terms of gauge theory ones . 
 more generally , the unitarity method provides a means for perturbatively quantizing massless gravity theories without the usual formal apparatus associated with the quantization of constrained systems . 
 as one application , this method was used to demonstrate that maximally supersymmetric gravity is less divergent in the ultraviolet than previously thought .

 m71 turns out to be in a low latitude disk - like orbit inside the galactic disk , further supporting the scenario in which it lost a significant fraction of its initial mass . since large differential reddening is known to affect this system , we took advantage of near - infrared , ground - based observations to re - determine the cluster center and density profile from direct star counts . 
 the new structural parameters turn out to be significantly different from the ones quoted in the literature . in particular

 the radiation flux has a fixed but arbitrary ( non - zero ) angular momentum . 
 the interaction with the radiation field is assumed to be thomson - like , i.e. , the particles absorb and re - emit radiation , thus suffering for a friction - like drag force . 
 such an additional force is responsible for the poynting - robertson effect , which is well established in the framework of newtonian gravity and has been recently extended to the general theory of relativity . 
 the balance between gravitational attraction , centrifugal force and radiation drag leads to the occurrence of equilibrium circular orbits which are attractors for the surrounding matter for every fixed value of the interaction strength . 
 the presence of the quadrupolar structure of the source introduces a further degree of freedom : there exists a whole family of equilibrium orbits parametrized by the quadrupole parameter , generalizing previous works . 
 this scenario is expected to play a role in the context of accretion matter around compact objects .

"in this paper , we continue the work begun in a previous article . 
 we compute , in the formalism of local composite operators , the value of the asymmetry in the dimension two condensate for finite temperatures . 
 we find a positive value for the asymmetry , which disappears when the temperature is increased . 
 we also compute the value of the full dimension two condensate for higher temperatures , and we find that it decreases in abolute value , finally disappearing for sufficiently high temperature

"we explore how the spiral spin(sp ) state , a spin singlet known to accompany fully - polarized ferromagnetic ( f ) states in the hubbard model , is related with the f state in the thermodynamic limit using the density matrix renormalization group and exact diagonalization . 
 we first obtain an indication that when the f state is the ground state the sp state is also eligible as the ground state in that limit . 
 we then follow the general argument by koma and tasaki [ j. stat . phys . * 
 76 * , 745 ( 1994 ) ] to find that : ( i ) the sp state possesses a kind of order parameter . 
 ( ii ) although the sp state does not break the su(2 ) symmetry in finite systems , it does so in the thermodynamic limit by making a linear combination with other states that are degenerate in that limit . 
 we also calculate the one - particle spectral function and dynamical spin and charge susceptibilities for various 1d finite - size lattices . 
 we find that the excitation spectrum of the sp state and the f state is almost identical . 
 our present results suggest that the sp and the f states are equivalent in the thermodynamic limit . 
 these properties may be exploited to determine the magnetic phase diagram from finite - size studies .    2"

"we present the results of detailed n - body simulations of clusters moving in a realistic milky way ( mw ) potential . 
 the strong interaction with the bulge and the disk of the galaxy leads to the formation of tidal tails , emanating from opposite sides of the cluster .

 the tails have a complex morphology , in particular when the cluster approaches its apogalacticon , showing multiple `` arms '' in remarkable similarity to the structures observed around ngc 288 and willman 1 . 
 + actually , the tails are generally good tracers of the cluster path quite far from the cluster center ( @xmath0@xmath1 tidal radii ) , while on the smaller scale they are mainly pointing in the direction of the galaxy center . 
 in particular , the orientation of the inner part of the tails is highly correlated to the cluster orbital phase and to the local orbital angular acceleration . 
 this implies that , in general , the orbital path can not be estimated directly from the orientation of the tails , unless a sufficient large field around the cluster is available ."
"recent work has demonstrated that there is a tight correlation between the mass of a black hole and the velocity dispersion of the bulge of its host galaxy . 
 we show that the model of kauffmann & haehnelt , in which bulges and supermassive black holes both form during major mergers , produces a correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 with slope and scatter comparable to the observed relation . in the model , 
 the @xmath2 relation is significantly tighter than the correlation between black hole mass and bulge luminosity or the correlation between bulge luminosity and velocity dispersion . 
 there are two reasons for this : i ) the gas masses of bulge progenitors depend on the velocity dispersion but not on the formation epoch of the bulge , whereas the stellar masses of the progenitors depend on both ; ii ) mergers between galaxies move black holes along the observed @xmath3 relation , even at late times when the galaxies are gas - poor and black holes grow mainly by merging of pre - existing black holes . we conclude that the small scatter in the observed @xmath2 relation is consistent with a picture in which bulges and black holes form over a wide range in redshift .    black hole physics  galaxies : formation  galaxies : nuclei quasars : general ."

"recently , vision - based advanced driver assist systems have gained broad interest . in this work , we investigate free - space detection , for which we propose to employ a fully convolutional network ( fcn ) . we show that this fcn can be trained in a _ self - supervised _ manner and achieve similar results compared to training on manually annotated data , thereby reducing the need for large manually annotated training sets . to this end , 
 our self - supervised training relies on a stereo - vision disparity system , to automatically generate ( weak ) training labels for the color - based fcn . 
 additionally , our self - supervised training facilitates _ 
 online _ training of the fcn instead of offline . 
 consequently , given that the applied fcn is relatively small , the free - space analysis becomes highly adaptive to any traffic scene that the vehicle encounters . 
 we have validated our algorithm using publicly available data and on a new challenging benchmark dataset that is released with this paper .

"classical cepheids are primary distance indicators playing a fundamental role in the calibration of the extragalactic distance scale . the possible dependence of their characteristic period - luminosity ( pl ) relation on chemical composition is still debated in the literature , and the behaviour of these pulsators at very low metallicity regimes is almost unexplored . in order to derive constraints on the application of the period - luminosity relation at low metal abundances 
 , we investigate the properties of the few ultra - low metallicity ( @xmath0 ) cepheids recently discovered in the blue compact dwarf galaxy izw18 . to this purpose 
 we have computed an updated and extended set of nonlinear convective models for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , spanning a wide range of stellar masses , and taking into account the evolutionary constraints for selected luminosity levels . as a result we are able to predict the topology of the instability strip , the variations of all the relevant quantities along the pulsation cycle , including the morphology of the light curves , the theoretical period - luminosity - color , period - wesenheit and period - luminosity relations at such a low metallicity . for each of these relations 
 we provide the appropriate coefficients for fundamental mode pulsators with z=0.0004 . by comparing these results with the properties of more metal rich cepheids

"measuring spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is attracting considerable attention as a probe of high energy particle physics in the cosmological context , since pixie and prism have recently been proposed . in this paper , 
 cmb distortions due to resonant conversions between cmb photons and light axion like particles ( alps ) are investigated , motivated by the string axiverse scenario which suggests the presence of a plenitude of light axion particles . 
 since these resonant conversions depend on the strength of primordial magnetic fields , constraints on cmb distortions can provide an upper limit on the product of the photon - alp coupling constant @xmath0 and the comoving strength of primordial magnetic fields @xmath1 . potentially feasible constraints from pixie / prism can set a limit @xmath2 for alp mass @xmath3 .

"we study experimentally the thermal fluctuations of energy input and dissipation in a harmonic oscillator driven out of equilibrium , and search for fluctuation relations .

"we examine the question of whether the formal expressions of equilibrium statistical mechanics can be applied to time independent non - dissipative systems that are not in true thermodynamic equilibrium and are nonergodic . by assuming the phase space 
 may be divided into time independent , locally ergodic domains , we argue that within such domains the relative probabilities of microstates are given by the standard boltzmann weights . 
 in contrast to previous energy landscape treatments , that have been developed specifically for the glass transition , we do not impose an a priori knowledge of the inter - domain population distribution . assuming that these domains are robust with respect to small changes in thermodynamic state variables we derive a variety of fluctuation formulae for these systems . 
 we verify our theoretical results using molecular dynamics simulations on a model glass forming system . 
 non - equilibrium transient fluctuation relations are derived for the fluctuations resulting from a sudden finite change to the system s temperature or pressure and these are shown to be consistent with the simulation results . 
 the necessary and sufficient conditions for these relations to be valid are that the domains are internally populated by boltzmann statistics and that the domains are robust . 
 the transient fluctuation relations thus provide an independent quantitative justification for the assumptions used in our statistical mechanical treatment of these systems ."
"we present the results of a numerical study on the effects of metal enrichment and metal cooling on galaxy formation and cosmic star formation ( sf ) history using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations . 
 we find following differences in the simulation with metal cooling when compared to the run without it : ( 1 ) the cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) is enhanced by about 50 & 20% at @xmath0 & 3 , respectively ; ( 2 ) the gas mass fraction in galaxies is lower ; ( 3 ) the total baryonic mass function ( gas + star ) at @xmath1 does not differ significantly , but shows an increase in the number of relatively massive galaxies at @xmath0 ; ( 4 ) the baryonic mass fraction of intergalactic medium ( igm ) is reduced at @xmath2 due to more efficient cooling and gas accretion onto galaxies . 
 our results suggest that the metal cooling enhances the galaxy growth by two different mechanisms : ( 1 ) increase of sf efficiency in the local interstellar medium ( ism ) , and ( 2 ) increase of igm accretion onto galaxies . 
 the former process is effective throughout most of the cosmic history , while the latter is effective only at @xmath2 when the igm is sufficiently enriched by metals owing to feedback .

"we present an unbiased method for evaluating the ranges of ages and metallicities which are allowed by the photometric properties of the stellar populations that dominate the light of early - type galaxies in clusters . 
 the method is based on the analysis of morphologically - classified early - type galaxies in @xmath0 clusters at redshifts @xmath1 and in the nearby coma cluster using recent stellar population synthesis models that span a wide range of metallicities . 
 we confirm that metallicity effects must play a role in the origin of the slope of the color - magnitude relation for cluster early - type galaxies . 
 we show , however , that the small scatter of the color - magnitude relation out to redshifts @xmath2 does not formally imply a common epoch of major star formation for all early - type galaxies . instead 
 , it requires that galaxies assembling more recently be on average more metal - rich than older galaxies of similar luminosity . 
 regardless of the true ages and metallicities of early - type galaxies within the allowed range , their photometric properties and the implied strengths of several commonly used spectral indices are found to be consistent with _ apparently _ passive evolution of the stellar populations . 
 also , the implied dependence of the mass - to - light ratio on galaxy luminosity is consistent with the observed trend . 
 the results of our unbiased analysis define the boundaries in age and metallicity that must be satisfied by theoretical studies aimed at explaining the formation and evolution of early - type galaxies in clusters .    0.5truecm    1truecm    ( accepted for publication in the _ astrophysical journal _ )"

 the epac correlation function is in very good agreement with the exact one at @xmath1 . 
 when the time increases from zero , the epac method gives good coincidence with the exact result at lower temperature .

"effective field theories are the most general tool for the description of low energy phenomena . they are universal and systematic : they can be formulated for any low energy systems we can think of and offer a clear guide on how to calculate predictions with reliable error estimates , a feature that is called power counting . these properties can be easily understood in wilsonian renormalization , in which effective field theories are the low energy renormalization group evolution of a more fundamental perhaps unknown or unsolvable high energy theory . in nuclear physics 
 they provide the possibility of a theoretically sound derivation of nuclear forces without having to solve quantum chromodynamics explicitly . 
 however there is the problem of how to organize calculations within nuclear effective field theory : the traditional knowledge about power counting is perturbative but nuclear physics is not . yet 
 power counting can be derived in wilsonian renormalization and there is already a fairly good understanding of how to apply these ideas to non - perturbative phenomena and in particular to nuclear physics . here 
 we review a few of these ideas , explain power counting in two - nucleon scattering and reactions with external probes and hint at how to extend the present analysis beyond the two - body problem ."
"we study diffusion and consensus based optimization of a sum of unknown convex objective functions over distributed networks . 
 the only access to these functions is through stochastic gradient oracles , each of which is only available at a different node , and a limited number of gradient oracle calls is allowed at each node . in this framework , we introduce a convex optimization algorithm based on the stochastic gradient descent ( sgd ) updates . particularly , we use a carefully designed time - dependent weighted averaging of the sgd iterates , which yields a convergence rate of @xmath0 after @xmath1 gradient updates for each node on a network of @xmath2 nodes . 
 we then show that after @xmath1 gradient oracle calls , the average sgd iterate achieves a mean square deviation ( msd ) of @xmath3 . 
 this rate of convergence is optimal as it matches the performance lower bound up to constant terms . 
 similar to the sgd algorithm , the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm also scales linearly with the dimensionality of the data . 
 furthermore , the communication load of the proposed method is the same as the communication load of the sgd algorithm . 
 thus , the proposed algorithm is highly efficient in terms of complexity and communication load .

"we study the effects of strong coupling of a localized state charge to one - dimensional electronic channels out of equilibrium . while the state of this charge and the coupling strengths determine the scattering phase shifts in the channels , 
 the nonequilibrium partitioning noise induces the tunneling transitions to the localized state . 
 the strong coupling leads to a nonperturbative backaction effect which is manifested in the orthogonality catastrophe and the fermi - edge singularity in the transition rates .

 the kernel interaction modification with temperature is approximated using the mixed representation in the imaginary time formalism and then we adopt an adiabatic ( instantaneous ) approximation after evaluating the matsubara frequencies sum . 
 the results of bse are compared with those for mit bag model . 
 we argue the bag pressure is a temperature dependent and it decreases smoothly with temperature to be consistent with the results for bse . 
 furthermore , the nucleon bound state obtained by bse ceases to exist just below the critical temperature and this indicates that the nucleon deconfines to its constituent quarks at the critical temperature .

"in this article we provide a general analysis of canonical quantization for polaritons in dispersive and dissipative electromagnetic inhomogeneous media .

 we show that in order to preserve unitarity , causality and time symmetry one must necessarily include with an equal footing both electromagnetic modes and material fluctuations in the evolution equations . 
 this becomes particularly relevant for all nanophotonics and plasmonics problems involving spatially localized antennas or devices ."
"we develop a complete analytical description of the time evolution of squeezed states of a charged particle under the fock - darwin hamiltonian and a time - dependent electric field . 
 this result generalises a relation obtained by infeld and plebaski for states of the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator . 
 we relate the evolution of a state - vector subjected to squeezing to that of state which is not subjected to squeezing and for which the time - evolution under the simple harmonic oscillator dynamics is known ( e.g. an eigenstate of the hamiltonian ) . 
 a corresponding relation is also established for the wigner functions of the states , in view of their utility in the analysis of cold - ion experiments . in an appendix 
 , we compute the response functions of the fd hamiltonian to an external electric field , using the same techniques as in the main text ."
"we describe a semi - empirical atomic basis extended hckel theoretical ( eht ) technique that can be used to calculate bulk bandstructure , surface density of states , electronic transmission and interfacial chemistry of various materials within the same computational platform . 
 we apply this method to study multiple technologically important systems , starting with carbon - nanotubes ( cnt ) and their interfaces in this paper , and silicon - based heterostructures in our follow - up paper . 
 we find that when it comes to quantum transport through interesting , complex heterostructures , the hckel bandstructure offers a fair and practical compromise between orthogonal tight - binding theories ( otb ) with limited transferability between environments under large distortion , and density functional theories ( dft ) that are computationally quite expensive for the same purpose ."
"a compact , quasi-4@xmath0 position sensitive silicon array , tiara , designed to study direct reactions induced by radioactive beams in inverse kinematics is described here . 
 the transfer and inelastic all - angle reaction array ( tiara ) consists of 8 resistive charge division detectors forming an octagonal barrel around the target and a set of double - sided silicon - strip annular detectors positioned at each end of the barrel . 
 the detector was coupled to the @xmath1-ray array exogam and the spectrometer vamos at the ganil laboratory to demonstrate the potential of such an apparatus with radioactive beams .

"i point to an interesting similarity in the radio and the soft x - ray light curves between the november 2009 outburst of the x - ray binary aquila  x-1 and some solar flares . 
 the ratio of the soft x - ray and radio luminosities of aquila  x-1 in that outburst is also similar to some weak solar flares , and so is the radio spectrum near 8  ghz . 
 based on these , as well as on some other recent studies that point to some similar properties of accretion disk coronae and stellar flares , such as ratio of radio to x - ray luminosities ( laor & behar 2008 ) , i speculate that the soft x - ray outburst of aquila  x-1 was related to a huge magnetic flare from its disk corona ."
"spectral diagnostic features formed in the solar chromosphere are few and difficult to interpret  they are neither formed in the optically thin regime nor in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) . to probe the state of the chromosphere , both from observations and theory

"the success of product quantization ( pq ) for fast nearest neighbor search depends on the exponentially reduced complexities of both storage and computation with respect to the codebook size . 
 recent efforts have been focused on employing sophisticated optimization strategies , or seeking more effective models . 
 residual quantization ( rq ) is such an alternative that holds the same property as pq in terms of the aforementioned complexities . 
 in addition to being a direct replacement of pq , hybrids of pq and rq can yield more gains for approximate nearest neighbor search . 
 this motivated us to propose a novel approach to optimizing rq and the related hybrid models . with an observation of the general randomness increase in a residual space 
 , we propose a new strategy that jointly learns a local transformation per residual cluster with an ultimate goal to reduce overall quantization errors . 
 we have shown that our approach can achieve significantly better accuracy on nearest neighbor search than both the original and the optimized pq on several very large scale benchmarks ."
"the fermi flare advocate ( also known as gamma - ray sky watcher , fa - gsw ) service provides for a daily quicklook analysis and review of the high - energy gamma - ray sky seen by the fermi gamma - ray space telescope . 
 the duty offers alerts for potentially new gamma - ray sources , interesting transients and relevant flares . a public weekly digest containing the main highlights about the gev gamma - ray sky 
 is published in the web - based fermi sky blog . during the first 3 years of all - sky survey , 
 more than 150 astronomical telegrams , several alerts to the tev cherenkov telescopes , and targets of opportunity to swift and other observatories have been distributed .

"the lagrangian dynamics of the velocity gradient tensor * a * in isotropic and homogeneous turbulence depend on the joint action of the self - streching term and the pressure hessian . 
 existing closures for pressure effects in terms of * a * are unable to reproduce one important statistical role played by the anisotropic part of the pressure hessian , namely the redistribution of the probabilities towards enstrophy production dominated regions . as a step towards elucidating the required properties of closures , we study several synthetic velocity fields and how well they reproduce anisotropic pressure effects . 
 it is found that synthetic ( i ) gaussian , ( ii ) multifractal and ( iii ) minimal turnover lagrangian map ( mtlm ) incompressible velocity fields reproduce many features of real pressure fields that are obtained from numerical simulations of the navier stokes equations , including the redistribution towards enstrophy - production regions . 
 the synthetic fields include both spatially local , and nonlocal , anisotropic pressure effects . 
 however , we show that the local effects appear to be the most important ones : by assuming that the pressure hessian is local in space , an expression in terms of the hessian of the second invariant @xmath0 of the velocity gradient tensor can be obtained . 
 this term is found to be well correlated with the true pressure hessian both in terms of eigenvalue magnitudes and eigenvector alignments ."

"the availability of new data sources on human mobility is opening new avenues for investigating the interplay of social networks , human mobility and dynamical processes such as epidemic spreading . here 
 we analyze data on the time - resolved face - to - face proximity of individuals in large - scale real - world scenarios . 
 we compare two settings with very different properties , a scientific conference and a long - running museum exhibition . 
 we track the behavioral networks of face - to - face proximity , and characterize them from both a static and a dynamic point of view , exposing differences and similarities . 
 we use our data to investigate the dynamics of a susceptible - infected model for epidemic spreading that unfolds on the dynamical networks of human proximity . 
 the spreading patterns are markedly different for the conference and the museum case , and they are strongly impacted by the causal structure of the network data . a deeper study of the spreading paths shows that the mere knowledge of static aggregated networks would lead to erroneous conclusions about the transmission paths on the dynamical networks ."
"i study the effect of scalar and spin - orbit absorption potentials , in the production of a nonzero sivers - like asymmetry in hadron - hadron high energy collisions ( drell - yan and single spin asymmetries ) . a basic model is built for the intrinsic state of a quark in the projectile hadron . 
 s - wave and p - wave 2-component states are considered . before the hard event 
 , this quark is subject to absorbing mean fields simulating interactions with a composite target . 
 the relevant interaction terms are found to be the imaginary diagonal spin - orbit ones . 
 spin rotating terms , and scalar absorption , seem not to be decisive . for @xmath0 @xmath1 0 the found sivers asymmetry vanishes , while at larger @xmath0 its qualitative dependence on @xmath0 , @xmath2 follows the usual trends met in available models and parameterizations . given the present - day knowledge of the considered phenomenological interactions , it is not possible to establish whether the related sivers - like asymmetry is a leading twist - one .    high energy hadron - hadron scattering , sivers asymmetry , spin - orbit forces ."

"the content of hickson compact groups in the southern hemisphere is measured using data from the parkes all - sky survey ( hipass ) , and dedicated observations using the narrow band filter on the multibeam instrument on the parkes telescope . 
 the expected mass of these groups was estimated using the luminosity , diameter and morphological types of the member galaxies , calibrated from published data . taking careful account of non - detection limits , 
 the results show that the compact group population that has been detected by these observations has an content similar to that of galaxies in the reference field sample . 
 the upper limits for the undetected groups lie within the normal range ; improvement of these limits will require a large increase in sensitivity .

"a broad range of membrane proteins display anomalous diffusion on the cell surface . 
 different methods provide evidence for obstructed subdiffusion and diffusion on a fractal space , but the underlying structure inducing anomalous diffusion has never been visualized due to experimental challenges . 
 we addressed this problem by imaging the cortical actin at high resolution while simultaneously tracking individual membrane proteins in live mammalian cells . 
 our data confirm that actin introduces barriers leading to compartmentalization of the plasma membrane and that membrane proteins are transiently confined within actin fences . 
 furthermore , superresolution imaging shows that the cortical actin is organized into a self - similar meshwork . 
 these results present a hierarchical nanoscale picture of the plasma membrane ."

"we present a model for separator reconnection due to an isolated reconnection process . 
 separator reconnection is a process which occurs in the neighbourhood of a distinguished field line ( the separator ) connecting two null points of a magnetic field . 
 it is , for example , important for the dynamics of magnetic flux at the dayside magnetopause and in the solar corona . 
 we find that , above a certain threshold , such a reconnection process generates new separators which leads to a complex system of magnetic flux tubes connecting regions of previously separated flux . 
 our findings are consistent with the findings of large numbers of separators in numerical simulations . 
 we discuss how to measure and interpret the reconnection rate in a configuration with multiple separators ."
"we investigate here the genericity and stability aspects for naked singularities and black holes that arise as the final states for a complete gravitational collapse of a spherical massive matter cloud . 
 the form of the matter considered is a general _ type i _ 
 matter field , which includes most of the physically reasonable matter fields such as dust , perfect fluids and such other physically interesting forms of matter widely used in gravitation theory . 
 we first study here in some detail the effects of small pressure perturbations in an otherwise pressure - free collapse scenario , and examine how a collapse evolution that was going to the black hole endstate would be modified and go to a naked singularity , once small pressures are introduced in the initial data . 
 this allows us to understand the distribution of black holes and naked singularities in the initial data space . 
 collapse is examined in terms of the evolutions allowed by einstein equations , under suitable physical conditions and as evolving from a regular initial data . 
 we then show that both black holes and naked singularities are generic outcomes of a complete collapse , when genericity is defined in a suitable sense in an appropriate space .

"approaches from statistical physics are applied to investigate the structure of network models whose growth rules mimic aspects of the evolution of the world - wide web . 
 we first determine the degree distribution of a growing network in which nodes are introduced one at a time and attach to an earlier node of degree @xmath0 with rate @xmath1 . 
 very different behaviors arise for @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 . 
 we also analyze the degree distribution of a heterogeneous network , the joint age - degree distribution , the correlation between degrees of neighboring nodes , as well as global network properties . 
 an extension to directed networks is then presented . by tuning model parameters to reasonable values , 
 we obtain distinct power - law forms for the in - degree and out - degree distributions with exponents that are in good agreement with current data for the web . 
 finally , a general growth process with independent introduction of nodes and links is investigated . 
 this leads to independently growing sub - networks that may coalesce with other sub - networks . 
 general results for both the size distribution of sub - networks and the degree distribution are obtained ."
"we introduce a growing network evolution model with nodal attributes . 
 the model describes the interactions between potentially violent @xmath0 and non - violent @xmath1 agents who have different affinities in establishing connections within their own population versus between the populations .

 , we employ the mean - field approximation to derive analytical expressions of the degree distribution and the local clustering coefficient for each type of nodes . 
 analytical derivations agree well with numerical simulation results . 
 the assortativity of the potentially violent network qualitatively resembles the connectivity pattern in terrorist networks that was recently reported . 
 the assortativity of the network driven by aggression shows clearly different behavior than the assortativity of the networks with connections of non - aggressive nature in agreement with recent empirical results of an online social system .

"we compute the spectral correlation function ( scf ) of @xmath0co j=10 maps of molecular cloud complexes . 
 the scf is a power law over approximately an order of magnitude in spatial separation in every map . 
 the power law slope of the scf , , its normalization , , and the spectral line width averaged over the whole map , @xmath1 , are computed for all the observational maps . 
 the values of  ,  and @xmath1 are combined to obtain empirical correlations to be used as tests for theoretical models of molecular clouds . 
 synthetic spectral maps are computed from different theoretical models , including solutions of the magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations with different values of the rms mach number of the flow and stochastic models with different power spectra of the velocity field . in order to compute the radiative transfer from the mhd models it is necessary to assign the models a physical scale and a physical density . when these assignments are made according to larson type relations the best fit to the observational correlations is obtained . 
 unphysical stochastic models are instead ruled out by the empirical correlations . 
 mhd models with equipartition of magnetic and kinetic energy of turbulence do not reproduce the observational data when their average magnetic field is oriented approximately parallel to the line of sight ."

 we refine the estimate of the transit ephemeris to @xmath3 = ( 2453527.87455^{+0.00085}_{-0.00091 } ) + ( 2.87598^{+0.00012}_{-0.00017 } ) \

 this density is significantly greater than that predicted for models which include the effects of stellar insolation and for which the planet has only a small core of solid material . 
 thus we confirm that this planet likely contains a large core , and that the ratio of core mass to total planet mass is more akin to that of uranus and neptune than that of either jupiter or saturn ."

"we develop a complete theoretical description of photoassociative stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) near a feshbach resonance in a thermal atomic gas .

 first , we formally specify a computational model for mapreduce which captures the functional flavor of the paradigm by allowing for a flexible use of parallelism . 
 indeed , the model diverges from a traditional processor - centric view by featuring parameters which embody only global and local memory constraints , thus favoring a more data - centric view .

 general features of the static case are that ( i ) there is no horizon , since @xmath0 is non - vanishing for finite values of the polar radius , and only vanishes ( in isotropic coordinates ) at the internal singularity , ( ii ) the ricci scalar @xmath1 vanishes identically , and ( iii ) there is a physical singularity at cosmological distances . the large distance singularity may be an artifact of the static restriction , since we find that the behavior at large distances is altered in a time - dependent solution using the mcvittie ansatz ."
"q - let is a fortran 77 code that enables a quick estimate of the gravitational lensing effects on a point- or an extended source . 
 the user provided input consists of the redshifts , angular positions relative to the source , mass or velocity dispersion estimate and halo type for the lens galaxies . 
 the considered halo types are the navarro - frenk - white and the singular isothermal sphere . 
 the code uses the so - called multiple lens - plane method to find the magnification and intrinsic shape of the source . 
 this method takes into account the multiple deflections that may arise when several mass accumulations are situated at different redshifts close to the line - of - sight . 
 the q - let code is applied to the recently discovered supernova , sn2003es , which is likely to be of type ia as its host galaxy is classified as an elliptical . 
 we find that sn2003es is likely to have been significantly magnified by gravitational lensing and that this should be considered in high-@xmath0 studies if this sn is to be used to determine the cosmological parameters . 
 q - let was motivated by the supernova searches , where lensing can be a problem , but it can also be applied to any simple lens system where a quick estimate is wanted , e.g.  the single lens case ."
"for each integer @xmath0 , we apply gluing methods to construct sequences of minimal surfaces embedded in the round @xmath1-sphere . 
 we produce two types of sequences , all desingularizing collections of intersecting clifford tori . 
 sequences of the first type converge to a collection of @xmath2 clifford tori intersecting with maximal symmetry along these two circles . near each of the circles , after rescaling , the sequences converge smoothly on compact subsets to a karcher - scherk tower of order @xmath2 . 
 sequences of the second type desingularize a collection of the same @xmath2 clifford tori supplemented by an additional clifford torus equidistant from the original two circles of intersection , so that the latter torus orthogonally intersects each of the former @xmath2 tori along a pair of disjoint orthogonal circles , near which the corresponding rescaled sequences converge to a singly periodic scherk surface . the simpler examples of the first type resemble surfaces constructed by choe and soret @xcite by different methods where the number of handles desingularizing each circle is the same . 
 there is a plethora of new examples which are more complicated and on which the number of handles for the two circles differs . 
 examples of the second type are new as well ."
"we have generated a novel form of shear banding in a 2d foam and measured the relative magnitude of drag forces on soap films at different lubrication layers . 
 we injected air part way along a flowing bubble field in a narrow hele - shaw cell . 
 the injected air inflates bubbles as they flow by , and these bubbles form a shear band down the middle of the hele - shaw cell . 
 this channel appears to select a height that minimizes the total dissipation .

"under certain conditions , hg(cd)te quantum wells ( qws ) are known to realize a time - reversal symmetric , two - dimensional topological insulator phase . 
 its low - energy excitations are well - described by the phenomenological bernevig - hughes - zhang ( bhz ) model that interpolates between schrdinger and dirac fermion physics . 
 we study the polarization function of this model in random phase approximation ( rpa ) in the intrinsic limit and at finite doping . while the polarization properties in rpa of dirac and schrdinger particles are two comprehensively studied problems , our analysis of the bhz model bridges the gap between these two limits , shedding light on systems with intermediate properties . 
 we gain insight into the screening properties of the system and on its characteristic plasma oscillations . 
 interestingly , we discover two different kinds of plasmons that are related to the presence of intra- and interband excitations

"the low energy regime of 5d braneworld models with a bulk scalar field is studied . 
 the setup is rather general and includes the randall - sundrum and dilatonic braneworlds models as particular cases . 
 we discuss the cosmological evolution of the system and conclude that , in a two brane system , the negative tension brane is generally expected to evolve towards a null warp - factor state . 
 this implies , for late time cosmology , that both branes end up interacting weakly . 
 we also analyze the observational constraints imposed by solar - system and binary - pulsar tests on the braneworld configuration . 
 this is done by considering the small deviations produced by the branes on the 4d gravitational interaction between bodies in the same brane . using these constraints 
 we show that the geometry around the braneworld is strongly warped , and that both branes must be far apart ."
"we report on the distribution of metallicities , [ fe / h ] , for very metal - poor stars in the halo of the galaxy .

"we construct magnetostatic models of coronal loops in which the thermodynamics of the loop is fully consistent with the shape and geometry of the loop . 
 this is achieved by treating the loop as a thin , compact , magnetic fibril that is a small departure from a force - free state . 
 the density along the loop is related to the loop s curvature by requiring that the lorentz force arising from this deviation is balanced by buoyancy . 
 this equilibrium , coupled with hydrostatic balance and the ideal gas law , then connects the temperature of the loop with the curvature of the loop without resorting to a detailed treatment of heating and cooling . 
 we present two example solutions : one with a spatially invariant magnetic bond number ( the dimensionless ratio of buoyancy to lorentz forces ) and the other with a constant radius of curvature of the loop s axis . 
 we find that the density and temperature profiles are quite sensitive to curvature variations along the loop , even for loops with similar aspect ratios ."
"we introduce the stochastic domino cellular automaton model exhibiting avalanches . 
 depending of the choice of the parameters , the model covers wide range of properties : various types of exponential and long tail ( up to inverse - power ) distributions of avalanches are observed . 
 the stationary state of automaton is described by a set of nonlinear discrete equations derived in an exact way from elementary combinatorial arguments . 
 these equations allow to derive formulas explaining both various exponential and inverse power distributions relating them to values of the parameters . 
 the exact relations between the state variable of the model ( moments ) are derived in two ways : from direct arguments and from the set of equations . 
 excellent agreement of the obtained analytical results with numerical simulations is observed ."
"transporting solids of different sizes is an essential process in the evolution of protoplanetary disks and planet formation . 
 large solids are supposed to drift inward ; high - temperature minerals found in comets are assumed to have been transported outward . from low - gravity experiments on parabolic flights we studied the light - induced erosion of dusty bodies caused by a solid - state greenhouse effect and photophoresis within a dust bed s upper layers . 
 tje gravity levels studied were 0.16@xmath0 , 0.38@xmath0 , 1@xmath0 , and 1.7@xmath0 . 
 the light flux during the experiments was 12 @xmath1 2 kw m@xmath2 and the ambient pressure was 6 @xmath1 0.9 mbar . 
 light - induced erosion is strongly gravity dependent , which is in agreement with a developed model . 
 in particular for small dusty bodies ( ( sub)-planetesimals ) , efficient erosion is possible at the optically thin inner edges of protoplanetary disks . 
 light - induced erosion prevents significant parts of a larger body from moving too close to the host star and be being subsequently accreted . 
 the small dust produced continues to be subject to photophoresis and is partially transported upward and outward over the surface of the disk ; the resulting small dust particles observed over the disk s lifetime . 
 the fraction of eroded dust participates in subsequent cycles of growth during planetesimal formation . 
 another fraction of dust might be collected by a body of planetary size if this body is already present close to the disk edge . either way , 
 light induced erosion is an efficient recycling process in protoplanetary disks ."

"a multi - wavelength spatial and temporal analysis of solar high energy electrons is conducted using the august 20 , 2002 flare of an unusually flat ( @xmath0 ) hard x - ray spectrum . 
 the flare is studied using rhessi , h@xmath1 , radio , trace , and mdi observations with advanced methods and techniques never previously applied in the solar flare context . a new method to account for x - ray compton backscattering in the photosphere ( photospheric albedo ) has been used to deduce the primary x - ray flare spectra . 
 the mean electron flux distribution has been analysed using both forward fitting and model independent inversion methods of spectral analysis . 
 we show that the contribution of the photospheric albedo to the photon spectrum modifies the calculated mean electron flux distribution , mainly at energies below @xmath2100  kev . 
 the positions of the h@xmath1 emission and hard x - ray sources with respect to the current - free extrapolation of the mdi photospheric magnetic field and the characteristics of the radio emission provide evidence of the closed geometry of the magnetic field structure and the flare process in low altitude magnetic loops . in agreement with the predictions of some solar flare models ,

"we report on the _ suzaku _ observation of neutron star low - mass x - ray binary cygnus x-2 which reveals a presence of the iron k@xmath0 emission line . 
 the line profile shows a significant red wing . 
 this discovery increases the number of neutron star sources where red - skewed iron lines were observed and strongly suggests that this phenomenon is common not only in black holes but also in other types of accreting compact objects . 
 we examine the line profile in terms of models which attribute its production to the relativistic effects due to reflection of x - ray radiation from a cold accretion disk and also as a result of the line formation in the extended wind / outflow configuration . 
 both models are able to adequately represent the observed line profile . 
 we consider the results of line modeling in the context of subsecond variability . while we were unable to conclusively disqualify one of the models , we find that the wind paradigm has several advantages over the relativistic disk reflection model ."

"a general and rigorous methodology to compute the quantum equilibrium isotope effect is described . unlike standard approaches 
 , ours does not assume separability of rotational and vibrational motions and does not make the harmonic approximation for vibrations or rigid rotor approximation for the rotations . 
 in particular , zero point energy and anharmonicity effects are described correctly quantum mechanically . 
 the approach is based on the thermodynamic integration with respect to the mass of isotopes and on the feynman path integral representation of the partition function . 
 an efficient estimator for the derivative of free energy is used whose statistical error is independent of the number of imaginary time slices in the path integral , speeding up calculations by a factor of @xmath0 at @xmath1 @xmath2 and more at room temperature . 
 we describe the implementation of the methodology in the molecular dynamics package amber 10 . 
 the method is tested on three [ 1,5 ] sigmatropic hydrogen shift reactions . because of the computational expense , we use ab initio potentials to evaluate the equilibrium isotope effects within the harmonic approximation , and then the path integral method together with semiempirical potentials to evaluate the anharmonicity corrections . 
 our calculations show that the anharmonicity effects amount up to @xmath3 of the symmetry reduced reaction free energy .

 while differing in several details , the generic properties of the afterglow from chase are similar to luminescence seen in some vacuum compounds .

"the advent of quantum devices , which exploit the two essential elements of quantum physics , coherence and entanglement , has sparked renewed interest in the control of open quantum systems . 
 successful implementations face the challenge to preserve the relevant nonclassical features at the level of device operation . 
 a major obstacle is decoherence which is caused by interaction with the environment . 
 optimal control theory is a tool that can be used to identify control strategies in the presence of decoherence . 
 we review here recent advances in optimal control methodology that allow for tackling typical tasks in device operation for open quantum systems and discuss examples of relaxation - optimized dynamics .

"we consider a server with large capacity delivering video files encoded in various resolutions . 
 we assume that the system is under saturation in the sense that the total demand exceeds the server capacity @xmath0 . 
 in such case , requests may be rejected . 
 for the policies considered in this paper , instead of rejecting a video request , it is downgraded . 
 when the occupancy of the server is above some value @xmath1 , the server delivers the video at a minimal bit rate . 
 the quantity @xmath2 is the bit rate adaptation threshold . 
 for these policies , request blocking is thus replaced with bit rate adaptation . under the assumptions of poisson request arrivals and exponential service times , 
 we show that , by rescaling the system , a process associated with the occupancy of the server converges to some limiting process whose invariant distribution is computed explicitly . 
 this allows us to derive an asymptotic expression of the key performance measure of such a policy , namely the equilibrium probability that a request is transmitted at requested bitrate .

"we develop the theory of interstellar scintillation as caused by an irregular plasma having a power - law spatial density spectrum with a spectral exponent of @xmath0 corresponding to a medium with abrupt changes in its density . 
 an `` outer scale '' is included in the model representing the typical scale over which the density of the medium remains uniform . 
 such a spectrum could be used to model plasma shock fronts in supernova remnants or other plasma discontinuities . 
 we investigate and develop equations for the decorrelation bandwidth of diffractive scintillations and the refractive scintillation index and compare our results with pulsar measurements . 
 we consider both a medium concentrated in a thin layer and an extended irregular medium . we conclude that the @xmath0 model gives satisfactory agreement for many diffractive measurements , in particular the vlbi meaurements of the structure function exponent between 5/3 and 2 . 
 however , it gives less satisfactory agreement for the refractive scintillation index than does the kolmogorov turbulence spectrum . 
 the comparison suggests that the medium consists of a pervasive background distribution of turbulence embedded with randomly placed discrete plasma structures such as shocks or hii regions . 
 this can be modeled by a composite spectrum following the kolmogorov form at high wavenumbers and steepening at lower wavenumbers corresponding to the typical ( inverse ) size of the discrete structures . 
 such a model can also explain the extreme scattering events . 
 however , lines of sight through the enhanced scattering prevalent at low galactic latitudes are accurately described by the kolmogorov spectrum in an extended medium and do not appear to have a similar low - wavenumber steepening ."

"the distribution of the sunspot group size ( area ) and its dependence on the level of solar activity is studied . 
 it is shown that the fraction of small groups is not constant but decreases with the level of solar activity so that high solar activity is largely defined by big groups . 
 we study the possible influence of solar activity on the ability of a realistic observer to see and report the daily number of sunspot groups . 
 it is shown that the relation between the number of sunspot groups as seen by different observers with different observational acuity thresholds is strongly non - linear and can not be approximated by the traditionally used linear scaling ( @xmath0factors ) . the observational acuity threshold [ @xmath1 is considered to quantify the quality of each observer , instead of the traditional relative @xmath0factor .

 detailed investigation of exit - time pdf shows that the pdf is divided into two regions , the region - i and -ii , reflecting two types of separating processes : persistent expansion and random transitions between expansion and compression of relative separation .

 the 24  images show a rich variety of structures , including nuclear point sources , rings , disks , and smooth extended emission . 
 comparisons to matched - resolution co and radio continuum images suggest that the bulk of the 24  emission can be traced to star formation with some notable exceptions . 
 the 24  luminosities of the co - rich galaxies are typically a factor of 15 larger than what would be expected from the dust associated with their evolved stars . 
 in addition , fir / radio flux density ratios are consistent with star formation .

 this means that the amplitudes , pitch angles , and rotational frequencies of the spiral arms are not constant , but change within a few hundred million years ( i.e. the typical rotational period of a galaxy ) . 
 we also find that the clear grand - design spirals in barred galaxies appear _ only when _ the spirals connect with the ends of the bar . 
 furthermore , we find that the short - term behaviour of spiral arms in the outer regions ( @xmath1 1.52 bar radius ) can be explained by the swing amplification theory and that the effects of the bar are not negligible in the inner regions ( @xmath2 1.52 bar radius ) . 
 these results suggest that , although grand - design spiral arms in barred galaxies are affected by the stellar bar , the grand - design spiral arms essentially originate not as bar - driven stationary density waves , but rather as self - excited dynamic patterns . we imply that a rigidly rotating grand - design spiral could not be a reasonable dynamical model for investigating gas flows and cloud formation even in barred spiral galaxies .

"we present a detailed calculation of intensities of two - phonon and four - phonon raman peaks in graphene . writing the low - energy hamiltonian of the interaction of electrons with the crystal vibrations and the electromagnetic field from pure symmetry considerations , we describe the system in terms of just a few independent coupling constants , considered to be parameters of the theory . 
 the electron scattering rate is introduced phenomenologically as another parameter . 
 the results of the calculation are used to extract information about these parameters from the experimentally measured raman peak intensities . in particular , the raman intensities are sensitive to the electron scattering rate , which is not easy to measure by other techniques . 
 also , the raman intensities depend on electron - phonon coupling constants ; to reproduce the experimental results , one has to take into account renormalization of these coupling constants by electron - electron interaction ."
"the dynamical response of the abrikosov vortex lattice in the presence of an oscillating driving field is calculated by constructing an analytical solution of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation . 
 the solution is steady - state , and work done by the input signal is dissipated through vortex cores , mainly by scattering with phonons . 
 the response is nonlinear in the input signal , and is verified for consistency within the theory . 
 the existence of well - defined parameters to control nonlinear effects is important for any practical application in electronics , and a normalised distance from the normal - superconducting phase - transition boundary is found to be such a parameter to which the response is sensitive . 
 favourable comparison with nbn experimental data in the optical region is made , where the effect is in the linear regime . 
 predictions are put forward regarding the suppression of heating and also the lattice configuration at high frequency ."

"we present a study of the radial velocity offsets between narrow emission lines and host galaxy lines ( stellar absorption and h  i 21-cm emission ) in seyfert galaxies with observed redshifts less than 0.043 . 
 we find that 35% of the seyferts in the sample show [ o  iii ] emission lines with blueshifts with respect to their host galaxies exceeding 50 km s@xmath0 , whereas only 6% show redshifts this large , in qualitative agreement with most previous studies . 
 we also find that a greater percentage of seyfert 1 galaxies show blueshifts than seyfert 2 galaxies . using _ 
 spatially - resolved spectra of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc  1068 and the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  4151 , we generate geometric models of their narrow - line regions ( nlrs ) and inner galactic disks , and show how these models can explain the blueshifted [ o  iii ] emission lines in collapsed stis spectra of these two seyferts . 
 we conclude that the combination of mass outflow of ionized gas in the nlr and extinction by dust in the inner disk ( primarily in the form of dust spirals ) is primarily responsible for the velocity offsets in seyfert galaxies . 
 more exotic explanations are not needed . 
 we discuss the implications of this result for the velocity offsets found in higher redshift agn ."
"the mesoscopic organization of complex systems , from financial markets to the brain , is an intermediate between the microscopic dynamics of individual units ( stocks or neurons , in the mentioned cases ) , and the macroscopic dynamics of the system as a whole . 
 the organization is determined by `` communities '' of units whose dynamics , represented by time series of activity , is more strongly correlated internally than with the rest of the system . 
 recent studies have shown that the binary projections of various financial and neural time series exhibit nontrivial dynamical features that resemble those of the original data . 
 this implies that a significant piece of information is encoded into the binary projection ( i.e. the sign ) of such increments . 
 here , we explore whether the binary signatures of multiple time series can replicate the same complex community organization of the financial market , as the original weighted time series . we adopt a method that has been specifically designed to detect communities from cross - correlation matrices of time series data . 
 our analysis shows that the simpler binary representation leads to a community structure that is almost identical with that obtained using the full weighted representation . 
 these results confirm that binary projections of financial time series contain significant structural information ."

 the model is able to reproduce the main statistical properties of both populations under the hypotheses that ( i ) star formation and quasar shining follow an anti - hierarchical order , and ( ii ) galaxy morphology and final black hole mass are determined by the same physical process ."
"we present results from _ xmm  newton _  observations of the obscured qso . 
 we find that the previously reported optical and soft x  ray counterpart positions are incorrect . 
 however we confirm the spectroscopic redshift of 0.176 .

 the x  ray spectrum is well described by a power - law ( @xmath0 ) absorbed by an intrinsic neutral column density of @xmath1 . 
 we find that any scattered emission contributes at most 0.5 percent to the total x  ray flux . from the optical 
 / near  ir colour we estimate that the active nucleus must contribute at least 50 percent of the total flux in the k band and that the ratio of extinction to x  ray absorption is @xmath2 times that expected from a galactic dust - gas ratio and extinction curve . if  were @xmath3 less luminous it would be indistinguishable from the population responsible for most of the 210 kev x  ray background .

"in this article , we propose an improved multiple feedback successive interference cancellation ( imf - sic ) algorithm for symbol vector detection in multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) spatial multiplexing systems . 
 the multiple feedback ( mf ) strategy in successive interference cancellation ( sic ) is based on the concept of shadow area constraint ( sac ) where , if the decision falls in the shadow region multiple neighboring constellation points will be used in the decision feedback loop followed by the conventional sic . the best candidate symbol from multiple neighboring symbols 
 is selected using the maximum likelihood ( ml ) criteria . however , while deciding the best symbol from multiple neighboring symbols , the sac condition may occur in subsequent layers which results in inaccurate decision . in order to overcome this limitation , in the proposed algorithm , 
 sac criteria is checked recursively for each layer . 
 this results in successful mitigation of error propagation thus significantly improving the bit error rate ( ber ) performance . 
 further , we also propose an ordered imf - sic ( oimf - sic ) where we use log likelihood ratio ( llr ) based dynamic ordering of the detection sequence . in oimf - sic 
 , we use the term dynamic ordering in the sense that the detection order is updated after every successful decision . 
 simulation results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the existing detectors such as conventional sic and mf - sic in terms of ber , and achieves a near ml performance .

"an accurate fitting formula is reported for the two - point correlation function @xmath0 of the dark matter halos in hierarchical clustering models . 
 it is valid for the linearly clustering regime , and its accuracy is about 10% in @xmath1 for the halos with mass @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the characteristic non - linear mass . 
 the result is found on the basis of a careful analysis for a large set of scale - free simulations with @xmath4 particles . the fitting formula has a weak explicit dependence on the index @xmath5 of the initial power spectrum , but can be equally well applied to the cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmological models if the effective index @xmath6 of the cdm power spectrum at the scale of the halo mass replaces the index @xmath5 . 
 the formula agrees with the analytical formula of mo & white ( mw96 ) for massive halos with @xmath7 , but the mw96 formula significantly underpredicts @xmath0 for the less massive halos . 
 the difference between the fitting and the analytical formulae amounts to a factor @xmath8 in @xmath0 for @xmath9 . 
 one of the most interesting applications of this fitting formula would be the clustering of galaxies since the majority of halos hosting galaxies satisfies @xmath10 .

"we consider the jastrow pair - product wavefunction for the strongly correlated bose systems , in our case liquid helium-4 . 
 an ansatz is proposed for the pair factors which consists of a numeric solution to a modified and parametrized pair scattering equation .

"we use high resolution n - body / sph simulations to study the hydrodynamical interaction between the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and the hot halo of the milky way .

 in the case of a face - on disk ( according to mastropietro et al .

"high resolution molecular line observations of , , ,  and  were obtained toward the starless globule  in order to investigate its kinematics and chemistry . 
 the hco@xmath0 and cs spectra show clear self - reversed and asymmetric profiles across the face of the globule . 
 the sense of the observed asymmetry is indicative of the global presence of expansion motions in the outer layers of the globule . 
 these motions appear to be subsonic and significantly below the escape velocity of the globule . 
 comparison of our observations with near - infrared extinction data indicate that the globule is gravitationally bound . taken together these considerations lead us to suggest that the observed expansion has its origin in an oscillatory motion of the outer layers of the globule which itself is likely in a quasi - stable state near hydrostatic equilibrium . 
 analysis of the observed linewidths of c@xmath1o  and  confirm that thermal pressure is the dominant component of the cloud s internal support . 
 a simple calculation suggests that the dominant mode of pulsation would be an l = 2 mode with a period of @xmath2 @xmath3 yrs . 
 deformation of the globule due to the large amplitude l = 2 oscillation may be responsible for the double - peaked structure of the core detected in high resolution extinction maps .

"we study the problem of generating a test sequence that achieves maximal coverage for a reactive system under test . 
 we formulate the problem as a repeated game between the tester and the system , where the system state space is partitioned according to some coverage criterion and the objective of the tester is to maximize the set of partitions ( or coverage goals ) visited during the game . 
 we show the complexity of the maximal coverage problem for non - deterministic systems is pspace - complete , but is np - complete for deterministic systems . for the special case of non - deterministic systems with a re - initializing `` reset '' action , which represent running a new test input on a re - initialized system , 
 we show that the complexity is again co - np - complete .

"binary central stars have long been invoked to explain the vexing shapes of planetary nebulae ( pne ) despite there being scant direct evidence to support this hypothesis .

 examples are given for the qubit case . 
 for qubit measurement with zero qubit hamiltonian , we find analytic solutions for average trajectories and their variances while conditioning on fixed initial and final states . for qubit measurement with unitary evolution

 moreover , we consider continuous qubit measurement with feedback control , using the action principle to investigate the global dynamics of its most likely paths , and finding that in an ideal case , qubit state stabilization at any desired pure state is possible with linear feedback .

"future multi - tier communication networks will require enhanced network capacity and reduced overhead . in the absence of channel state information ( csi ) at the transmitters , blind interference alignment ( bia ) and topological interference management ( tim ) can achieve optimal degrees of freedom ( dof ) , minimizing network s overhead . 
 in addition , non - orthogonal multiple access ( noma ) can increase the sum rate of the network , compared to orthogonal radio access techniques currently adopted by 4 g networks . 
 our contribution is two interference management schemes , bia and a hybrid tim - noma scheme , employed in heterogeneous networks by applying user - pairing and kornecker product representation . 
 bia manages inter- and intra - cell interference by antenna selection and appropriate message scheduling . 
 the hybrid scheme manages intra - cell interference based on noma and inter - cell interference based on tim . 
 we show that both schemes achieve at least double the rate of tdma . 
 the hybrid scheme always outperforms tdma and bia in terms of degrees of freedom ( dof ) . comparing the two proposed schemes , 
 bia achieves more dof than tdma under certain restrictions , and provides better bit - error - rate ( ber ) and sum rate perfomance to macrocell users , whereas the hybrid scheme improves the performance of femtocell users ."
"we used h@xmath0 - 0.1  nm and magnetic field ( at 1.56@xmath1 ) data obtained with the new solar telescope to study the origin of the disk counterparts to type ii spicules , so - called rapid blueshifted excursions ( rbes ) . 
 the high time cadence of our chromospheric ( 10  s ) and magnetic field ( 45  s ) data allowed us to generate x - t plots using slits parallel to the spines of the rbes . these plots , along with potential field extrapolation , led us to suggest that the occurrence of rbes is generally correlated with the appearance of new , mixed or unipolar fields in close proximity to network fields . 
 rbes show a tendency to occur at the interface between large - scale fields and small - scale dynamic magnetic loops and thus are likely to be associated with existence of a magnetic canopy .

"according to the may - wigner stability theorem , increasing the complexity of a network inevitably leads to its destabilization , such that a small perturbation will be able to disrupt the entire system . 
 one of the principal arguments against this observation is that it is valid only for random networks , and therefore does not apply to real - world networks , which presumably are structured . 
 here we examine how the introduction of small - world topological structure into networks affect their stability . 
 our results indicate that , in structured networks , the parameter values at which the stability - instability transition occurs with increasing complexity is identical to that predicted by the may - wigner criteria . however , the nature of the transition , as measured by the finite - size scaling exponent , appears to change as the network topology transforms from regular to random , with the small - world regime as the cross - over region . 
 this behavior is related to the localization of the largest eigenvalues along the real axis in the eigenvalue plain with increasing regularity in the network .

"we investigate the role of the boundary in the symmetric simple exclusion process with competing nonlocal and local hopping events . with open boundaries , 
 the system undergoes a first order phase transition from a finite density phase to an empty road phase as the nonlocal hopping rate increases . using a cluster stability analysis 
 , we determine the location of such an abrupt nonequilibrium phase transition , which agrees well with numerical results . 
 our cluster analysis provides a physical insight into the mechanism behind this transition . 
 we also explain why the transition becomes discontinuous in contrast to the case with periodic boundary conditions , in which the continuous phase transition has been observed ."
"we explore the use of the resource of intra - particle entanglement for secure quantum key distribution in the device - independent scenario . by virtue of the local nature of such entanglement ,

 is the fact that such entanglement can be easily generated using linear optics ."
"we present new spectroscopic observations of the gravitational arcs and the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) in the cluster ms2137 - 23 ( @xmath0 ) obtained with the echelle spectrograph and imager on the keck ii telescope .

 we combine the measured stellar velocity dispersion profile of the bcg with a lensing analysis to constrain the distribution of dark and stellar matter in the central 100 kpc of the cluster . 
 our data indicate a remarkably flat inner slope for the dark matter profile , @xmath2 , with @xmath3 at 99% cl . 
 steep inner slopes obtained in cold dark matter cosmological simulations  such as navarro frenk & white ( @xmath4 ) or moore ( 1.5 ) universal dark matter profiles  are ruled out at better than @xmath5%cl . 
 as baryon collapse is likely to have steepened the dark matter profile from its original form , our data provides a powerful test of the cold dark matter paradigm at the cluster mass scale ."

"fragment average isospin distributions are investigated within a microcanonical multifragmentation model in different regions of the phase diagram . 
 the results indicate that in the liquid phase @xmath0 versus @xmath1 is monotonically increasing , in the phase coexistence region it has a rise and fall shape and in the gas phase it is constant . 
 deviations from this behavior may manifest at low fragment multiplicity as a consequence of mass / charge conservation .

"we outline an interferometric scheme for the detection of bi - mode and multi - mode spatial entanglement of finite - temperature , interacting bose gases . whether entanglement is present in the gas depends on the existence of the single - particle reduced density matrix between different regions of space . 
 we apply the scheme to the problem of a harmonically trapped repulsive boson pair and show that while entanglement is rapidly decreasing with temperature , a significant amount remains for all interaction strengths at zero temperature . 
 thus , by tuning the interaction parameter , the distribution of entanglement between many spatial modes can be modified ."
"electron transport in electric - field - driven tight - binding lattice coupled to fermion baths is comprehensively studied . 
 we reformulate the problem by using the scattering state method within the coulomb gauge . 
 calculations show that the formulation justifies direct access to the steady - state bypassing the time - transient calculations , which then makes the steady - state methods developed for quantum dot theories applicable to lattice models . 
 we show that the effective temperature of the hot - electron induced by a dc electric field behaves as @xmath0 with a numerical constant @xmath1 , tight - binding parameter @xmath2 , the bloch oscillation frequency @xmath3 and the damping parameter @xmath4 . in the small damping limit @xmath5 
 , the steady - state has a singular property with the electron becoming extremely hot in an analogy to the short - circuit effect .

"optical reference geometry and related concept of inertial forces are investigated in kerr - de sitter spacetimes .

 the intuitive newtonian application of the forces in the relativistic dynamics is demonstrated in the case of the test particle circular motion , static equilibrium positions and perfect fluid toroidal configurations . 
 features of the optical geometry are illustrated by the embedding diagrams of its equatorial plane . 
 the embedding diagrams do not cover whole the stationary regions of the spacetimes , therefore the limits of embeddability are established . 
 a shape of the embedding diagrams is related to the behaviour of the centrifugal force and it is characterized by the number of turning points of the diagrams . 
 discussion of the number of embeddable photon circular orbits is also included and the typical embedding diagrams are constructed .

"we use thermochemical equilibrium calculations to model iron , magnesium , and silicon chemistry in the atmospheres of giant planets , brown dwarfs , extrasolar giant planets ( egps ) , and low - mass stars . the behavior of individual fe- , mg- , and si - bearing gases and condensates is determined as a function of temperature , pressure , and metallicity . 
 our results are thus independent of any particular model atmosphere . 
 the condensation of fe metal strongly affects iron chemistry by efficiently removing fe - bearing species from the gas phase . 
 monatomic fe is the most abundant fe - bearing gas throughout the atmospheres of egps and l dwarfs and in the deep atmospheres of giant planets and t dwarfs . mg- and

"the formation of regular precipitate stripes in the wake of moving chemical reaction - diffusion fronts is investigated .

 computer simulations reproduced the parallel and the oblique striping as well . 
 stripes perpendicular to the front are unstable and can not be observed , in complete agreement with the experiments . 
 pattern formation in the wake of quenching fronts has also been investigated computationally , and compared to the previous results . 
 it has been shown that below a certain front speed stripes perpendicular to the front will appear . moreover

"we use a time - dependent dynamical mean - field - hydrodynamic model to study mixing - demixing in a degenerate fermion - fermion mixture ( dffm ) . 
 it is demonstrated that with the increase of interspecies repulsion and/or trapping frequencies , a mixed state of dffm could turn into a fully demixed state in both three - dimensional spherically - symmetric as well as quasi - one - dimensional configurations . 
 such a demixed state of a dffm could be experimentally realized by varying an external magnetic field near a fermion - fermion feshbach resonance , which will result in an increase of interspecies fermion - fermion repulsion , and/or by increasing the external trap frequencies .

"icecube , a future km@xmath0 antarctic ice cherenkov neutrino telescope , is highly sensitive to a galactic supernova ( sn ) neutrino burst . 
 the cherenkov light corresponding to the total energy deposited by the sn neutrinos in the ice can be measured relative to background fluctuations with a statistical precision much better than 1% . 
 if the sn is viewed through the earth , the matter effect on neutrino oscillations can change the signal by more than 5% , depending on the flavor - dependent source spectra and the neutrino mixing parameters . 
 therefore , icecube together with another high - statistics experiment like hyper - kamiokande can detect the earth effect , an observation that would identify specific neutrino mixing scenarios that are difficult to pin down with long - baseline experiments . 
 in particular , the normal mass hierarchy can be clearly detected if the third mixing angle is not too small , @xmath1 . 
 the small flavor - dependent differences of the sn neutrino fluxes and spectra that are found in state - of - the - art simulations suffice for this purpose . 
 although the absolute calibration uncertainty at icecube may exceed 5% , the earth effect would typically vary by a large amount over the duration of the sn signal , obviating the need for a precise calibration . 
 therefore , icecube with its unique geographic location and expected longevity can play a decisive role as a `` co - detector '' to measure sn neutrino oscillations . 
 it is also a powerful stand - alone sn detector that can verify the delayed - explosion scenario ."
"the absolute magnitude and perihelion distributions of long - period comets are derived , using data from the lincoln near - earth asteroid research ( linear ) survey . 
 the results are surprising in three ways . 
 firstly , the flux of comets through the inner solar system is much lower than some previous estimates . 
 secondly , the expected rise in comet numbers to larger perihelia is not seen . 
 thirdly , the number of comets per unit absolute magnitude does not significantly rise to fainter magnitudes . 
 these results imply that the oort cloud contains many fewer comets than some previous estimates , that small long - period comets collide with the earth too infrequently to be a plausible source of tunguska - style impacts , and that some physical process must have prevented small icy planetesmals from reaching the oort cloud , or have rendered them unobservable . a tight limit 
 is placed on the space density of interstellar comets , but the predicted space density is lower still

"in graph modification problems , one is given a graph  @xmath0 and the goal is to apply a minimum number of modification operations ( such as edge deletions ) to  @xmath0 such that the resulting graph fulfills a certain property . 
 for example , the cluster deletion problem asks to delete as few edges as possible such that the resulting graph is a disjoint union of cliques . 
 graph modification problems appear in numerous applications , including the analysis of biological and social networks . 
 typically , graph modification problems are np - hard , making them natural candidates for parameterized complexity studies .

 the reason for this failure is that the local flow in the vicinity of a particle is treated as if it were a steady hyperbolic flow , whereas in reality it must fluctuate . 
 we derive exact expressions for the steady - state collision rate for particles suspended in rapidly fluctuating random flows and compute how this steady state is approached . for incompressible flows , the saffman - turner expression is an upper bound ."

"we study theoretically the spatiotemporal response of a lipid membrane submitted to a local chemical change of its environment , taking into account the time - dependent profile of the reagent concentration due to diffusion in the solution above the membrane .

 it then becomes possible to extract interesting properties of the membrane response to the chemical modification . 
 we find that a local density asymmetry between the two monolayers relaxes by spreading diffusively in the whole membrane . 
 this behavior is driven by intermonolayer friction . 
 moreover , we show how the ratio of the spontaneous curvature change to the equilibrium density change induced by the chemical modification can be extracted from the dynamics of the local membrane deformation .

"for a gas trapped in a harmonic potential , the sloshing ( or kohn ) mode is undamped and its frequency coincides with the trap frequency , independently of the statistics , interaction and temperature of the gas .

 we study the sloshing mode of a degenerate fermi gas in an anharmonic trap within the boltzmann equation , including in - medium effects in both the transport and collision terms . 
 the calculated frequency shifts and damping rates of the sloshing mode due to the trap anharmonicity are in satisfactory agreement with the available experimental data .

 considerable insight into the nature of individual transitions is adduced by examining the momentum matrix element for bulk transitions within the solid and by further decomposing this matrix element into contributions from various atomic sites and angular momentum channels .

 we explicitly compute these two time scales in a generic situation to show that resonances are easily achieved . during an outburst of a transient black hole candidate ( bhc ) , the accretion rate of the keplerian disk as well as the geometry of the comptonizing cloud change very rapidly . during some period , 
 resonance condition between the cooling time scale ( predominantly by comptonization ) and the infall time scale of the comptonizing cloud is roughly satisfied . 
 this leads to low frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( lfqpos ) of the compton cloud and the consequent oscillation of hard x - rays . in this paper 
 , we explicitly follow the bhc h  1743 - 322 during its 2010 outburst . 
 we compute compton cooling time and infall time on several days and show that qpos take place when these two roughly agree within @xmath0% , i.e. , the resonance condition is generally satisfied . 
 we also confirm that for the sharper lfqpos ( i.e. , higher q - factors ) the ratio of two time scales is very close to 1 .

"we investigate energy transport in several two - level atom or spin-1/2 models by a direct coupling to heat baths of different temperatures . 
 the analysis is carried out on the basis of a recently derived quantum master equation which describes the nonequilibrium properties of internally weakly coupled systems appropriately . 
 for the computation of the stationary state of the dynamical equations , we employ a monte carlo wave - function approach . 
 the analysis directly indicates normal diffusive or ballistic transport in finite models and hints toward an extrapolation of the transport behavior of infinite models ."
"it has been proposed that primordial gas in early dark matter halos , with virial temperatures @xmath0k , can avoid fragmentation and undergo rapid collapse , possibly resulting in a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) . 
 this requires the gas to avoid cooling and to remain at temperatures near @xmath1 k. we show that this condition can be satisfied in the presence of a sufficiently strong primordial magnetic field , which heats the collapsing gas via ambipolar diffusion . if the field has a strength above @xmath2 ( comoving ) ng , the collapsing gas is kept warm ( @xmath1 k ) until it reaches the critical density @xmath3 at which the roto  vibrational states of @xmath4 approach local thermodynamic equilibrium . 
 @xmath4cooling then remains inefficient , and the gas temperature stays near @xmath5k , even as it continues to collapse to higher densities . 
 the critical magnetic field strength required to permanently suppress @xmath4cooling is somewhat higher than upper limit of @xmath6ng from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .

"this paper studies secrecy transmission with the aid of a group of wireless energy harvesting ( weh)-enabled amplify - and - forward ( af ) relays performing cooperative jamming ( cj ) and relaying . 
 the source node in the network does _ simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) _ with each relay employing a power splitting ( ps ) receiver in the first phase ; each relay further divides its harvested power for forwarding the received signal and generating artificial noise ( an ) for jamming the eavesdroppers in the second transmission phase . in the centralized case with global channel state information ( csi ) , we provide closed - form expressions for the optimal and/or suboptimal af - relay beamforming vectors to maximize the achievable secrecy rate subject to individual power constraints of the relays , using the technique of semidefinite relaxation ( sdr ) , which is proved to be tight . a fully _ distributed _ algorithm utilizing only local csi at each relay is also proposed as a performance benchmark .

"a radio tomographic imaging ( rti ) system uses the received signal strength ( rss ) measured by rf sensors in a static wireless network to localize people in the deployment area , without having them to carry or wear an electronic device . 
 this paper addresses the fact that small - scale changes in the position and orientation of the antenna of each rf sensor can dramatically affect imaging and localization performance of an rti system . 
 however , the best placement for a sensor is unknown at the time of deployment . 
 improving performance in a deployed rti system requires the deployer to iteratively `` guess - and - retest '' , _ i.e. _ , pick a sensor to move and then re - run a calibration experiment to determine if the localization performance had improved or degraded . 
 we present an rti system of _ servo - nodes _ , rf sensors equipped with servo motors which autonomously `` dial it in '' , _ 
 i.e. _ , change position and orientation to optimize the rss on links of the network . by doing so , 
 the localization accuracy of the rti system is quickly improved , without requiring any calibration experiment from the deployer . 
 experiments conducted in three indoor environments demonstrate that the servo - nodes system reduces localization error on average by 32% compared to a standard rti system composed of static rf sensors .

 this overdispersion is consistent with variability at the 2 - 7% level , and suggests that the coronae on the binary components of capella are composed of low - density plasma and low - lying loops ."
"the detection of bright x - ray flares superimposed on the regular afterglow decay in _ swift _ gamma - ray bursts has triggered theoretical speculations on their origin . 
 we study the temporal properties of flares due to internal dissipation and external shock mechanisms . 
 we first show that at least a sizable fraction of the flares can not be related to external shock mechanisms , since external shock flares evolve on much longer time scales than observed . 
 we then study flares from internal dissipation , showing that the temporal properties allow us to distinguish the emission of slow early shells from that of late faster shells . 
 we show that , due to the rapid evolution of the detected flares , it is most likely that the flares are produced by relatively fast shells ejected by the central engine shortly before they are observed . 
 this implies that the central engine must be active for , in some cases , as long as one day . 
 we finally discuss the constraints and implications that this observation has on the properties and physics of the inner engine , and we elaborate on possible future observational tests on the flare sample to further understand their origin and physics .

"the appearance of quark matter in the core of hybrid stars is a fundamental issue in such compact stars . 
 the central density of these stars is sufficiently high such that nuclear matter undergoes a further change into other exotic phases that consist of hyperons and quarks . 
 however , the equation of state ( eos ) for the high - density matter is still not clear and several recent observations have indicated the limitations of the eoss ; theoretical studies should try to elucidate the eoss . 
 it is believed that the inner regions of the stars should consist of a mixed hadron - quark phase . 
 we study the mixed hadron - quark phase , taking into account finite - size effects , and find that that the mixed phase should be restricted to a narrower region . 
 therefore , a quark matter phase should appear in the central region ."
"coherently driven atomic gases inside optical cavities hold great promises in generating rich dynamics and exotic states of matter . recently , it has been shown that a novel topological superradiant state exists in a two - component degenerate fermi gas coupled to a cavity , where local order parameters coexist with global topological invariants . in this work , 
 we characterise in detail various properties of this exotic state , focusing on the feedback interactions between the atoms and the cavity field . in particular , we demonstrate that the cavity - induced inter - band couplings play a crucial role in inducing the topological phase transition between the conventional and the topological superradiant state . 
 furthermore , we analyse how the closing and reopening of the atomic bulk gap across the topological phase boundary leaves interesting signatures in the cavity field .

"the binary coding theory and subspace codes for random network coding exhibit similar structures . 
 the method used to obtain a singleton bound for subspace codes mimic the technique used in obtaining the singleton bound for binary codes . 
 this motivates the question of whether there is an abstract framework that captures these similarities . as a first step towards answering this question 
 , we use the lattice framework proposed in @xcite . 
 a lattice is a partially ordered set in which any two elements have a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound . 
 a ` lattice scheme ' is defined as a subset of a lattice . in this paper 
 , we derive a singleton bound for lattice schemes and obtain singleton bounds known for binary codes and subspace codes as special cases . 
 the lattice framework gives additional insights into the behaviour of singleton bound for subspace codes . 
 we also obtain a _ new _ upper bound on the code size for non - constant dimension codes . 
 the plots of this bound along with plots of the code sizes of known non - constant dimension codes in the literature reveal that our bound is tight for certain parameters of the code ."
"tunable oscillatory modes of electric - field domains in doped semiconductor superlattices are reported . 
 the experimental investigations demonstrate the realization of tunable , ghz frequencies in gaas - alas superlattices covering the temperature region from 5 to 300  k. the orgin of the tunable oscillatory modes is determined using an analytical and a numerical modeling of the dynamics of domain formation . 
 three different oscillatory modes are found . 
 their presence depends on the actual shape of the drift velocity curve , the doping density , the boundary condition , and the length of the superlattice . for most bias regions , 
 the self - sustained oscillations are due to the formation , motion , and recycling of the domain boundary inside the superlattice . 
 for some biases , the strengths of the low and high field domain change periodically in time with the domain boundary being pinned within a few quantum wells . the dependency of the frequency on the coupling leads to the prediction of a new type of tunable ghz oscillator based on semiconductor superlattices .

 we found that our sample of low - redshift laes has an agn fraction of 43 @xmath3% , significantly higher than at high redshift . 
 while previous results have shown that low - redshift laes have a lower space density than their high - redshift analogs , these results show that star - forming laes at low - redshift are rarer still . 
 accounting for differences in available agn classification methods , we conclude that rest - frame optical spectroscopy is necessary to identify low - luminosity agns in laes at high redshift , and that limits on the x - ray flux are necessary to determine the extent to which the agn contaminates the ly@xmath4  fluxes ."
"deep architecture such as hierarchical semi - markov models is an important class of models for nested sequential data . 
 current exact inference schemes either cost cubic time in sequence length , or exponential time in model depth . 
 these costs are prohibitive for large - scale problems with arbitrary length and depth . in this contribution 
 , we propose a new approximation technique that may have the potential to achieve sub - cubic time complexity in length and linear time depth , at the cost of some loss of quality .

"while theoretical models and simulations of magnetic reconnection often assume symmetry such that the magnetic null point when present is co - located with a flow stagnation point , the introduction of asymmetry typically leads to non - ideal flows across the null point . to understand this behavior , we present exact expressions for the motion of three - dimensional linear null points . 
 the most general expression shows that linear null points move in the direction along which the vector field and its time derivative are antiparallel . 
 null point motion in resistive magnetohydrodynamics results from advection by the bulk plasma flow and resistive diffusion of the magnetic field , which allows non - ideal flows across topological boundaries . 
 null point motion is described intrinsically by parameters evaluated locally ; however , global dynamics help set the local conditions at the null point . during a bifurcation of a degenerate null point into a null - null pair or the reverse , 
 the instantaneous velocity of separation or convergence of the null - null pair will typically be infinite along the null space of the jacobian matrix of the magnetic field , but with finite components in the directions orthogonal to the null space . 
 not all bifurcating null - null pairs are connected by a separator . 
 furthermore , except under special circumstances , there will not exist a straight line separator connecting a bifurcating null - null pair . 
 the motion of separators can not be described using solely local parameters , because the identification of a particular field line as a separator may change as a result of non - ideal behavior elsewhere along the field line ."

"using the _ rossixte _ experiment , we detect weak x - ray emission from the recurrent be / x - ray transient a0535 + 26 at a time when the optical counterpart v725 tau displayed h@xmath0 in absorption , indicating the absence of a circumstellar disc . 
 the x - ray radiation is strongly modulated at the 103.5-s pulse period of the neutron star , confirming that it originates from a0535 + 26 . 
 the source is weaker than in previous quiescence detections by two orders of magnitude and should be in the centrifugal inhibition regime . 
 we show that the x - ray luminosity can not be due to accretion on to the magnetosphere of the neutron star . 
 therefore this detection represents a new state of the accreting pulsar . 
 we speculate that the x - ray emission can be due to some matter leaking through the magnetospheric barrier or thermal radiation from the neutron star surface due to crustal heating . 
 the observed luminosity is probably compatible with recent predictions of thermal radiation from x - ray transients in quiescence . 
 the detection of the x - ray source in the inhibition regime implies a reduced density in the outflow from the be companion during its disc - less phase ."
"we calculate the absorption efficiency of the composite grains , made up of host silicate spheroids and inclusions of ices / graphites / or voids , in the spectral region @xmath0 m the absorption efficiencies of the composite spheroidal grains for three axial ratios are computed using the discrete dipole approximation ( dda ) as well as using the effective medium approximation & t - matrix ( emt - tmatrix ) approach . 
 we study the absorption as a function of the volume fraction of the inclusions and porosity . 
 in particular , we study the variation in the @xmath1 m feature with the volume fraction of the inclusions and porosity . 
 we then calculate the infrared fluxes for these composite grains and compare the model curves with the average observed iras - lrs curve , obtained for several circumstellar dust shells around stars . 
 these results on the composite grains show that the wavelength of the peak absorption shifts and the width of the @xmath1 m feature varies with the variation in the volume fraction of the inclusions . 
 the model curves for composite grains with axial ratios not very large ( ar@xmath21.3 ) and volume fractions of inclusions with f=0.20 , and dust temperature of about 250 - 300@xmath3k , fit the observed emission curves reasonably well .

"attractive colloidal particles can form a disordered elastic solid or gel when quenched into a two - phase region , if the volume fraction is sufficiently large . 
 when the interactions are comparable to thermal energies the stress - bearing network within the gel restructures over time as individual particle bonds break and reform . 
 typically , under gravity such weak gels show a prolonged period of either no or very slow settling , followed by a sudden and rapid collapse - a phenomenon known as delayed collapse . 
 the link between local bond breaking events and the macroscopic process of delayed collapse is not well understood . here 
 we summarize the main features of delayed collapse and discuss the microscopic processes which cause it . 
 we present a plausible model which connects the kinetics of bond breaking to gel collapse and test the model by exploring the effect of an applied external force on the stability of a gel ."
"d - term inflation is one of the most interesting and versatile models of inflation . 
 it is possible to implement naturally d - term inflation within high energy physics , as for example susy guts , sugra , or string theories . 
 d - term inflation avoids the @xmath0-problem , while in its standard form it always ends with the formation of cosmic strings . 
 given the recent three - year wmap data on the cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies , we examine whether d - term inflation can be successfully implemented in non - minimal supergravity theories . 
 we show that for all our choices of khler potential , there exists a parameter space for which the predictions of d - term inflation are in agreement with the measurements . 
 the cosmic string contribution on the measured temperature anisotropies is always dominant , unless the superpotential coupling constant is fine tuned ; a result already obtained for d - term inflation within minimal supergravity . in conclusion , cosmic strings and their rle in the angular power spectrum can not be easily hidden by just considering a non - flat khler geometry ."

"thanks to s long exposures of the galactic plane , the two brightest soft gamma - ray repeaters , sgr 1806 - 20 and sgr 1900 + 14 , have been monitored and studied in detail for the first time at hard - x / soft gamma rays . 
 this has produced a wealth of new scientific results , which we will review here . since sgr 
 1806 - 20 was particularly active during the last two years , more than 300 short bursts have been observed with   and their characteristics have been studied with unprecedented sensitivity in the 15 - 200 kev range . 
 a hardness - intensity anticorrelation within the bursts has been discovered and the overall number - intensity distribution of the bursts has been determined . 
 in addition , a particularly active state , during which  100 bursts were emitted in  10 minutes , has been observed on october 5 2004 , indicating that the source activity was rapidly increasing . 
 this eventually led to the giant flare of december 27th 2004 , for which a possible soft gamma - ray ( @xmath080 kev ) early afterglow has been detected . 
 the deep observations allowed us to discover the persistent emission in hard x - rays ( 20 - 150 kev ) from 1806 - 20 and 1900 + 14 , the latter being in a quiescent state , and to directly compare the spectral characteristics of all magnetars ( two sgrs and three anomalous x - ray pulsars ) detected with ."

"we analyze the effects of lepton asymmetry on neutrino oscillations and on cosmological nucleosynthesis with active - sterile oscillating neutrinos . 
 it is shown that small lepton asymmetries , @xmath0 , whose direct kinetic effect on nucleosynthesis is negligible , still effect nucleosynthesis considerably through their influence on oscillating neutrinos . 
 two different cases of lepton asymmetry are discussed : an initially present and a dynamically generated in oscillations . _ dynamically generated in resonant oscillations asymmetry _ at small mixing angles suppresses oscillations , hence , the nucleosynthesis bounds on neutrino mass differences at small mixings are relaxed . 
 _ initially present asymmetry _ may suppress or enhance oscillations . 
 the enhancement is a result of interchanging resonances between neutrino and antineutrino ensembles due to resonance waves passing through the neutrino and antineutrino spectrum . 
 updated nucleosynthesis bounds on neutrino oscillation parameters accounting for lepton asymmetry are presented ."
"in this paper we present a very general theoretical framework for addressing fermionic superfluids over the entire range of bcs to bose einstein condensation ( bec ) crossover in the presence of population imbalance or spin polarization . 
 our emphasis is on providing a theory which reduces to the standard zero temperature mean field theories in the literature , but necessarily includes pairing fluctuation effects at non - zero temperature within a consistent framework . 
 physically , these effects are associated with the presence of pre - formed pairs ( or a fermionic pseudogap ) in the normal phase , and pair excitations of the condensate , in the superfluid phase . 
 we show how this finite @xmath0 theory of fermionic pair condensates bears many similarities to the condensation of point bosons . in the process 
 we examine three different types of condensate : the usual breached pair or sarma phase and both the one and two plane wave larkin- ovchinnikov , fulde - ferrell ( loff ) states .

"hybrid inflation can be realised in low - energy effective string theory , as described using supergravity . 
 we find that the coupling of moduli to @xmath0-term hybrid inflation in supergravity leads to a slope and a curvature for the inflaton potential . 
 the @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameters receive contributions at tree and one loop level which are not compatible with slow roll inflation . furthermore the coupling to the moduli sector can even prevent inflation from ending at all . 
 we show that introducing shift symmetries in the inflationary sector and taking the moduli sector to be no - scale removes most of these problems . 
 if the moduli fields are fixed during inflation , as is usually assumed , it appears that viable slow - roll inflation can then be obtained with just one fine - tuning of the moduli sector parameters . 
 however , we show this is not a reasonable assumption , and that the small variation of the moduli fields during inflation gives a significant contribution to the effective inflaton potential .

"network epidemiology often assumes that the relationships defining the social network of a population are static . 
 the dynamics of relationships is only taken indirectly into account , by assuming that the relevant information to study epidemic spread is encoded in the network obtained by considering numbers of partners accumulated over periods of time roughly proportional to the infectious period of the disease at hand . on the other hand , 
 models explicitly including social dynamics are often too schematic to provide a reasonable representation of a real population , or so detailed that no general conclusions can be drawn from them . here 
 we present a model of social dynamics that is general enough that its parameters can be obtained by fitting data from surveys about sexual behaviour , but that can still be studied analytically , using mean field techniques . 
 this allows us to obtain some general results about epidemic spreading . 
 we show that using accumulated network data to estimate the static epidemic threshold leads to a significant underestimation of it . 
 we also show that , for a dynamic network , the relative epidemic threshold is an increasing function of the infectious period of the disease , implying that the static value is a lower bound to the real threshold ."
"this study proceeds with the development of the technique employing velocity gradients that were identified in ( @xcite , henceforth gl17 ) as a means of probing magnetic field in interstellar media . 
 we demonstrate a number of practical ways on improving the accuracy of tracing magnetic fields in diffuse interstellar media using velocity centroid gradients ( vcgs ) . addressing the magnetic field tracing in super - alfvenic turbulence 
 we introduce the procedure of filtering low spatial frequencies , that enables magnetic field tracing in the situations when the kinetic energy of turbulent plasmas dominate its magnetic energy . 
 we propose the synergic way of of using vcgs together with intensity gradients ( igs ) , synchrotron intensity gradients ( sigs ) as well as dust polarimetry . 
 we show that while the igs trace magnetic field worse than the vcgs , the deviations of the angle between the igs and vcgs trace the shocks in diffuse media . 
 similarly the perpendicular orientation of the vcgs and the sigs or to the dust polarimetry data trace the regions of gravitational collapse . 
 we demonstrate the utility of combining the vcgs , igs and polarimetry using galfa hi and planck polarimetry data .

 we allow for general shapes of the density peaks , going beyond the common gaussian approximation . in all cases

"_ suzaku _ has , for the first time , enabled the hard x - ray variability of the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15 to be measured . 
 the variability in the 1445  kev band , which is dominated by a strong reflection hump , is quenched relative to that at a few kev . 
 this directly demonstrates that the whole reflection spectrum is much less variable than the power - law continuum . 
 the broadband spectral variability can be decomposed into two components  a highly variable power - law and constant reflection  as previously inferred from other observations in the 210  kev band . 
 the strong reflection and high iron abundance give rise to a strong broad iron line , which requires the inner disc radius to be at about 2 gravitational radii . 
 our results are consistent with the predictions of the light bending model which invokes the very strong gravitational effects expected very close to a rapidly spinning black hole .

"we present a theory of single - magnet flowmeter for liquid metals and compare it with experimental results . 
 the flowmeter consists of a freely rotating permanent magnet , which is magnetized perpendicularly to the axle it is mounted on . 
 when such a magnet is placed close to a tube carrying liquid metal flow , it rotates so that the driving torque due to the eddy currents induced by the flow is balanced by the braking torque induced by the rotation itself . 
 the equilibrium rotation rate , which varies directly with the flow velocity and inversely with the distance between the magnet and the layer , is affected neither by the electrical conductivity of the metal nor by the magnet strength . 
 we obtain simple analytical solutions for the force and torque on slowly moving and rotating magnets due to eddy currents in a layer of infinite horizontal extent . 
 the predicted equilibrium rotation rates qualitatively agree with the magnet rotation rate measured on a liquid sodium flow in stainless steel duct ."
"we study the interaction between low - lying transverse collective oscillations and thermal excitations of an elongated bose - einstein condensate by means of perturbation theory . 
 we consider a cylindrically trapped condensate and calculate the transverse elementary excitations at zero temperature by solving the linearized gross - pitaevskii equations in two dimensions . 
 we use them to calculate the matrix elements between thermal excited states coupled with the quasi-2d collective modes . 
 the landau damping of transverse collective modes is investigated as a function of temperature . at low temperatures , the damping rate due to the landau decay mechanism is in agreement with the experimental data for the decay of the transverse quadrupole mode , but it is too small to explain the slow experimental decay of the transverse breathing mode . 
 the reason for this discrepancy is discussed ."
"the pairing hamiltonian constitutes an important approximation in many- body systems , it is exactly soluble and quantum integrable . on the other hand , the continuum single particle level density ( cspld ) contains information about the continuum energy spectrum . 
 the question whether one can use the hamiltonian with constant pairing strength for correlations in the continuum is still unanswered . in this paper 
 we generalize the richardson exact solution for the pairing hamiltonian including correlations in the continuum . 
 the resonant and non - resonant continuum are included through the cspld . 
 the resonant correlations are made explicit by using the cauchy theorem . 
 low lying states with seniority zero and two are calculated for the even carbon isotopes . 
 we conclude that energy levels can indeed be calculated with constant pairing in the continuum using the cspld . 
 it is found that the nucleus @xmath0c is unbound . 
 the real and complex energy representation of the continuum is developed and their differences are shown . 
 the trajectory of the pair energies in the continuum for the nucleus @xmath1c is shown ."
"a very high activity of cygnus x-1 on 1999 april 19 - 21 was recorded by batse large area detectors onboard the _ compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro)_. the peak luminosity was one order of magnitude higher than the normal luminosity of cyg x-1 . 
 this fact can be critical for models of the hard state of cyg x-1 . 
 the longest outburst lasted @xmath0  s and demonstrated very unusual temporal and spectral behavior which indicates the presence of two emission components . 
 one component is relatively soft ( with a cutoff below @xmath1 ) and highly variable , and the other one is hard ( extending above 100 kev ) , with much slower variability ."
"we compare our pion production results with recent miniboone data measured in mineral oil . 
 our total cross sections lie below experimental data for neutrino energies above 1gev . 
 differential cross sections show our model produces too few high energy pions in the forward direction as compared to data . 
 the agreement with experiment improves by artificially removing pion final state interaction ."
"stellar light from an agb star is scattered by the circumstellar dust and polarized in the direction perpendicular to the source . 
 therefore , images of circumstellar envelopes around agb stars in polarized light traces the dust distribution and can be used to search for asymmetries , and to achieve a better understanding of the mechanisms at play when agb stars are transformed into planetary nebulae . 
 the polcor instrument is a combined imager , polarimeter , and coronograph providing images with an angular resolution down to 02 . 
 we have used it to map the dust distribution around three agb stars : w  aql , and the detached shell sources dr  ser , and u  cam . 
 w  aql is a binary and we find indications of a bi - polar dust distribution around the star . 
 the observations of the latter two sources clearly reveal the detached shells , likely the result of a brief , strongly enhanced mass - loss rate during the late evolution of these stars . 
 mapping the detached shells gives us clues to the symmetry of the mass loss and important evolutionary processes ."
"rotational brownian motion of colloidal magnetic particles in ferrofluids under the influence of an oscillating external magnetic field is investigated . 
 it is shown that for a suitable time dependence of the magnetic field , a noise induced rotation of the ferromagnetic particles due to rectification of thermal fluctuations takes place . via viscous coupling , the associated angular momentum is transferred from the magnetic nano - particles to the carrier liquid and can then be measured as macroscopic torque on the fluid sample . 
 a thorough theoretical analysis of the effect in terms of symmetry considerations , analytical approximations , and numerical solutions is given which is in accordance with recent experimental findings ."
"it is demonstrated that strong laser pulses can introduce torsional motion in the axially chiral molecule 3,5-diflouro-3,5-dibromo - biphenyl ( dfdbrbph ) . 
 a nanosecond laser pulse spatially aligns the stereogenic carbon - carbon ( c - c ) bond axis allowing a perpendicularly polarized , intense femtosecond pulse to initiate torsional motion accompanied by a rotation about the fixed axis . 
 we monitor the induced motion by femtosecond time - resolved coulomb explosion imaging . 
 our theoretical analysis corroborates the experimental findings and on the basis of these results we discuss future applications of laser induced torsion , viz . , time - resolved studies of de - racemization and laser controlled molecular junctions based on molecules with torsion ."
"klein - gordon and dirac equations are the motion equations for relativistic particles with spin 0 ( so - called scalar particles ) and 1/2 ( electron / positron ) respectively . for a free particle , 
 the dirac equation is derived from the klein - gordon equation by taking its square root in a bi - quaternionic formalism fully justified by the first principles of the scale relativity theory . 
 this is no more true when an external electro - magnetic field comes into play . 
 if one tries to derive the electro - magnetic dirac equation in a manner analogous to the one used when this field is absent , one obtains an additional term which is the relativistic analogue of the spin - magnetic field coupling term encountered in the pauli equation , valid for a non - relativistic particle with spin 1/2 . 
 there is however a method to recover the standard form of the electro - magnetic dirac equation , with no additional term , which amounts modifying the way both covariances involved here , quantum and scale , are implemented . without going into technical details , 
 it will be shown how these results suggest this last method is based on more profound roots of the scale relativity theory since it encompasses naturally the spin - charge coupling ."
"our formal understanding of the inductive bias that drives the success of convolutional networks on computer vision tasks is limited . 
 in particular , it is unclear what makes hypotheses spaces born from convolution and pooling operations so suitable for natural images . in this paper 
 we study the ability of convolutional networks to model correlations among regions of their input . 
 we theoretically analyze convolutional arithmetic circuits , and empirically validate our findings on other types of convolutional networks as well . 
 correlations are formalized through the notion of separation rank , which for a given partition of the input , measures how far a function is from being separable . we show that a polynomially sized deep network supports exponentially high separation ranks for certain input partitions , while being limited to polynomial separation ranks for others . 
 the network s pooling geometry effectively determines which input partitions are favored , thus serves as a means for controlling the inductive bias . 
 contiguous pooling windows as commonly employed in practice favor interleaved partitions over coarse ones , orienting the inductive bias towards the statistics of natural images . 
 other pooling schemes lead to different preferences , and this allows tailoring the network to data that departs from the usual domain of natural imagery . 
 in addition to analyzing deep networks , we show that shallow ones support only linear separation ranks , and by this gain insight into the benefit of functions brought forth by depth 
 they are able to efficiently model strong correlation under favored partitions of the input ."
"the influence of the size and shape of a dispersing and absorbing dielectric body on the local - field corrected spontaneous - decay of an excited atom embedded in the body is studied on the basis of the real - cavity model . by means of a born expansion of the green tensor of the system

"we study the characteristics of the light generated by few emitters in a cavity at strong light - matter coupling . by means of the glauber @xmath0-function 
 we can identify clearly distinguished parameter regimes with super - poissonian and sub - poissonian photon statistics . 
 we establish a relation between the emission characteristics for one and multiple emitters , and explain its origin in terms of the photon - dressed emitter states . 
 cooperative effects lead to the generation of nonclassical light already at reduced light - matter coupling if the number of emitters is increased . 
 our results are obtained with a full input - output formalism and master equation valid also at strong light - matter coupling . 
 we compare the behavior obtained with and without counter - rotating light - matter interaction terms in the hamiltonian , and find that the generation of nonclassical light is robust against such modifications . 
 finally , we contrast our findings with the predictions of the quantum optical master equation and find that it fails entirely at predicting regimes with different photon statistics ."
"* purpose * : manipulation of the radio - sensitivity of the nucleotide - base driven by the spin blockade mechanism of diffusive free radicals against ionizing radiation . + * materials and methods * : we theoretically propose a mechanism which uses the simultaneous application of circularly polarized light and an external magnetic field to control the polarization of the free radicals and create s=1 electron - hole spin excitations ( excitons ) on nucleotide - base .

"we present vlt low resolution spectroscopy of the neutron star x - ray transient xte j2123 - 058 during its quiescent state . 
 our data reveal the presence of a k7v companion which contributes 77 % to the total flux at @xmath06300 and orbits the neutron star at @xmath1 km s@xmath2 . 
 contrary to other soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) , the @xmath3 emission is almost exactly in antiphase with the velocity curve of the optical companion . using the light - center technique we obtain @xmath4 km s@xmath2 and hence @xmath5 .

"we present the results of a series of one - dimensional n - body and hydrodynamical simulations which have been used for testing the different clustering properties of baryonic and dark matter in an expanding background . 
 initial gaussian random density perturbations with a power - law spectrum @xmath0 are assumed . 
 we analyse the distribution of density fluctuations and thermodynamical quantities for different spectral indices @xmath1 and discuss the statistical properties of clustering in the corresponding simulations . at large scales 
 the final distribution of the two components is very similar while at small scales the dark matter presents a lumpiness which is not found in the baryonic matter . 
 the amplitude of density fluctuations in each component depends on the spectral index @xmath1 and only for @xmath2 the amplitude of baryonic density fluctuations is larger than that in the dark component . 
 this result is also confirmed by the behaviour of the bias factor , defined as the ratio between the r.m.s of baryonic and dark matter fluctuations at different scales : while for @xmath3 it is always less than unity except at very large scales where it tends to one , for @xmath2 it is above 1.4 at all scales . 
 all simulations show also that there is not an exact correspondence between the positions of largest peaks in dark and baryonic components , as confirmed by a cross - correlation analysis . 
 the final temperatures depend on the initial spectral index : the highest values are obtained for @xmath2 and are in proximity of high density regions .

"cyclotron decay and absorption rates have been well studied in the literature , focusing primarily on spectral , angular and polarization dependence . 
 astrophysical applications usually do not require retention of information on the electron spin state , and these are normally averaged in obtaining the requisite rates . in magnetic fields , higher order quantum processes such as compton scattering become resonant at the cyclotron frequency and its harmonics , with the resonances being formally divergent . 
 such divergences are usually eliminated by accounting for the finite lifetimes of excited landau states . 
 this practice requires the use of spin - dependent cyclotron rates in order to obtain accurate determinations of process rates very near cyclotronic resonances , the phase space domain most relevant for certain applications to pulsar models . this paper develops previous results in the literature to obtain compact analytic expressions for cyclotron decay rates / widths in terms of a series of legendre functions of the second kind ; these expressions can be expediently used in astrophysical models . 
 the rates are derived using two popular eigenstate formalisms , namely that due to sokolov and ternov , and that due to johnson and lippmann . 
 these constitute two sets of eigenfunctions of the dirac equation that diagonalize different operators , and accordingly yield different spin - dependent cyclotron rates . 
 this paper illustrates the attractive lorentz transformation characteristics of the sokolov and ternov formulation , which is another reason why it is preferable when electron spin information must be explicitly retained ."

"a proof that continuous time quantum walks are universal for quantum computation , using unweighted graphs of low degree , has recently been presented by @xcite [ prl 102 180501 ( 2009 ) ] . 
 we present a version based instead on the discrete time quantum walk . 
 we show the discrete time quantum walk is able to implement the same universal gate set and thus both discrete and continuous time quantum walks are computational primitives . 
 additionally we give a set of components on which the discrete time quantum walk provides perfect state transfer ."
"the behavior of interacting populations typically displays irregular temporal and spatial patterns that are difficult to reconcile with an underlying deterministic dynamics . 
 a classical example is the heterogeneous distribution of plankton communities , which has been observed to be patchy over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales . here 
 , we use plankton communities as prototype systems to present theoretical approaches for the analysis of the combined effects of turbulent advection and stochastic growth in the spatiotemporal dynamics of the population . 
 incorporation of these two factors into mathematical models brings an extra level of realism to the description and leads to better agreement with experimental data than that of previously proposed models based on reaction - diffusion equations ."
"rigorous pointwise asymptotics are established for semiclassical soliton ensembles ( sses ) of the focusing nonlinear schrdinger equation using techniques of asymptotic analysis of matrix riemann - hilbert problems . 
 the accumulation of poles in the eigenfunction is handled using a new method in which the residues are simultaneously interpolated at the poles by two distinct interpolants . 
 the results justify the wkb approximation for the nonselfadjoint zakharov - shabat operator with real - analytic , bell - shaped , even potentials . 
 the new technique introduced in this paper is applicable to other problems as well : ( i ) it can be used to provide a unified treatment by riemann - hilbert methods of the zero - dispersion limit of the korteweg - de vries equation with negative ( soliton generating ) initial data as studied by lax , levermore , and venakides , and ( ii ) it allows one to compute rigorous strong asymptotics for systems of discrete orthogonal polynomials ."
"we present spatially resolved alma observations of the co @xmath0 emission line in two massive galaxies at @xmath1 on the star - forming main sequence . 
 both galaxies have compact dusty star - forming cores with effective radii of @xmath2 kpc and @xmath3 kpc in the 870 @xmath4 m continuum emission . 
 the spatial extent of star - forming molecular gas is also compact with @xmath5 kpc and @xmath6 kpc , but more extended than the dust emission . interpreting the observed position - velocity diagrams with dynamical models , we find the starburst cores to be rotation - dominated with the ratio of the maximum rotation velocity to the local velocity dispersion of @xmath7 ( @xmath8 km s@xmath9 ) and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 km s@xmath9 ) . given that the descendants of these massive galaxies in the local universe are likely ellipticals with @xmath12 nearly an order of magnitude lower 
 , the rapidly rotating galaxies would lose significant net angular momentum in the intervening time . 
 the comparisons among dynamical , stellar , gas , and dust mass suggest that the starburst co - to - h@xmath13 conversion factor of @xmath14 ( k km s@xmath9pc@xmath15)@xmath9 is appropriate in the spatially resolved cores . 
 the dense cores are likely to be formed in extreme environments similar to the central regions of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies . 
 our work also demonstrates that a combination of medium - resolution co and high - resolution dust continuum observations is a powerful tool for characterizing the dynamical state of molecular gas in distant galaxies ."
"observations of gamma - ray bursts by the fermi satellite , capable of detecting photons in a very broad energy band : 8kev to @xmath0300gev , have opened a new window for the study of these enigmatic explosions . 
 it is widely assumed that photons of energy larger than 100 mev are produced by the same source that generated lower energy photons  at least whenever the shape of the spectrum is a band function . 
 we report here a surprising result  the fermi data for a bright burst , grb 080916c , unambiguously shows that the high energy photons ( @xmath1mev ) were generated in the external shock via the synchrotron process , and the lower energy photons had a distinctly different source . the magnetic field in the region where high energy photons were produced ( and also the late time afterglow emission region ) is found to be consistent with shock compressed magnetic field of the circum - stellar medium . 
 this result sheds light on the important question of the origin of magnetic fields required for gamma - ray burst afterglows . 
 the external shock model for high energy radiation makes a firm prediction that can be tested with existing and future observations .

"the far  from  equilibrium low  temperature dynamics of ultra - thin magnetic films is analyzed by using monte carlo numerical simulations on a two dimensional ising model with competing exchange ( @xmath0 ) and dipolar ( @xmath1 ) interactions .

"we present the gamma - ray observations in the energy range 50  mev - 10  gev of the supernova remnant ( snr ) w44 , one of the most interesting systems for studying cosmic - ray production . 
 w44 is an intermediate - age snr ( @xmath0  years ) and its ejecta expand in a dense medium as shown by a prominent radio shell , nearby molecular clouds , and bright [ sii ] emitting regions . 
 we extend our gamma - ray analysis to energies substantially lower than previous measurements which could not conclusively establish the nature of the radiation . 
 we find that gamma - ray emission matches remarkably well both the position and shape of the inner snr shocked plasma . 
 furthermore , the gamma - ray spectrum shows a prominent peak near 1  gev with a clear decrement at energies below a few hundreds of mev as expected from neutral pion decay . 
 here we demonstrate that : ( 1 ) hadron - dominated models are consistent with all w44 multiwavelength constraints derived from radio , optical , x - ray , and gamma - ray observations ; ( 2 ) to explain simultaneously the well - constrained gamma - ray and radio spectra , and require a circumstellar density much larger than the value derived from observations ;"
"we propose a novel method to constrain the spatial extent of dust around galaxies through the measurement of dust temperature . 
 our method combines the dust emission of galaxies from far - infrared ( fir ) image stacking analysis and the quasar reddening due to the dust absorption around galaxies . as a specific application of our method 
 , we use the stacked fir emission profiles of sdss photometric galaxies over the _ iras _ @xmath0 map , and the recent measurement of the sdss galaxy - quasar cross - correlation . 
 if we adopt a single - temperature dust model , the resulting temperature is around 18k , which is consistent with a typical dust temperature for a central part of galaxies . if we assume an additional dust component with much lower temperature , the current data imply the temperature of the galactic dust needs to be higher , 20k to 30k . 
 since the model of the density and temperature distribution of dust adopted in the current paper is very simple , we can not draw any strong conclusion at this point . 
 nevertheless our novel method with the elaborated theoretical model and multi - band measurement of dust will offer an interesting constraint on the statistical nature of galactic dust .

 is observed due to the chemical complexity of this region , reliable molecular line identifications can be made , down to the noise floor , due to the large number of transitions detected for each species in the 1.2 thz survey bandwidth . 
 this allows for the extraction of new weakly emitting species from the line forest .

"by taking into account the local energy balance per unit volume between the viscous heating and the advective cooling plus the radiative cooling , we investigate the vertical structure of radiation pressure - supported accretion disks in spherical coordinates . 
 our solutions show that the photosphere of the disk is close to the polar axis and therefore the disk seems to be extremely thick . 
 however , the profile of density implies that most of the accreted matter exists in a moderate range around the equatorial plane . 
 we show that the well - known polytropic relation between the pressure and the density is unsuitable for describing the vertical structure of radiation pressure - supported disks . 
 more importantly , we find that the energy advection is significant even for slightly sub - eddington accretion disks . 
 we argue that the non - negligible advection may help to understand why the standard thin disk model is likely to be inaccurate above @xmath0 eddington luminosity , which was found by some works on the black hole spin measurement .

 , we typically find bubble sizes of the order of a few microns , independent of the size and speed of the impacting drop . 
 by contrast , the bubbles that are formed when coalescence starts at the contact line become increasingly large , as the size or the velocity of the impacting drop is increased . 
 we show how these observations can be explained from a balance between the lubrication pressure in the air layer and the capillary pressure of the drop ."
"the minimum - cost flow ( mcf ) problem is a fundamental optimization problem with many applications and seems to be well understood . over the last half century 
 many algorithms have been developed to solve the mcf problem and these algorithms have varying worst - case bounds on their running time . 
 however , these worst - case bounds are not always a good indication of the algorithms performance in practice . the network simplex ( ns ) 
 algorithm needs an exponential number of iterations for some instances , but it is considered the best algorithm in practice and performs best in experimental studies . on the other hand , 
 the minimum - mean cycle canceling ( mmcc ) algorithm is strongly polynomial , but performs badly in experimental studies .    to explain these differences in performance in practice we apply the framework of smoothed analysis . 
 we show an upper bound of @xmath0 for the number of iterations of the mmcc algorithm . here 
 @xmath1 is the number of nodes , @xmath2 is the number of edges , and @xmath3 is a parameter limiting the degree to which the edge costs are perturbed . 
 we also show a lower bound of @xmath4 for the number of iterations of the mmcc algorithm , which can be strengthened to @xmath5 when @xmath6 . for the number of iterations of the ns algorithm 
 we show a smoothed lower bound of @xmath7 ."
"we study the distribution of the time - integrated current in an exactly - solvable toy model of heat conduction , both analytically and numerically . 
 the simplicity of the model allows us to derive the full current large deviation function and the system statistics during a large deviation event . in this way 
 we unveil a relation between system statistics at the end of a large deviation event and for intermediate times . 
 midtime statistics is independent of the sign of the current , a reflection of the time - reversal symmetry of microscopic dynamics , while endtime statistics do depend on the current sign , and also on its microscopic definition . 
 we compare our exact results with simulations based on the direct evaluation of large deviation functions , analyzing the finite - size corrections of this simulation method and deriving detailed bounds for its applicability . 
 we also show how the gallavotti - cohen fluctuation theorem can be used to determine the range of validity of simulation results ."
"we revisit the problem of phantom behaviour of effective dark energy in scalar - tensor gravity . 
 the main focus is on the properties of the functions defining the model . 
 we find that models with the present phantom behavior can be made consistent with all constraints , but one of these functions must have rather contrived shape , and the initial data must be strongly fine - tuned . 
 also , the phantom stage must have begun fairly recently , at @xmath0 . 
 all this disfavors the effective phantom behaviour in the scalar - tensor gravity ."
"classification is an important task in many fields including biomedical research and machine learning . 
 traditionally , a classification rule is constructed based a bunch of labeled data . recently , due to technological innovation and automatic data collection schemes , we easily encounter with data sets containing large amounts of unlabeled samples . because to label each of them 
 is usually costly and inefficient , how to utilize these unlabeled data in a classifier construction process becomes an important problem . in machine learning literature , 
 active learning or semi - supervised learning are popular concepts discussed under this situation , where classification algorithms recruit new unlabeled subjects sequentially based on the information learned from previous stages of its learning process , and these new subjects are then labeled and included as new training samples . from a statistical aspect , these methods can be recognized as a hybrid of the sequential design and stochastic approximation procedure . in this paper , we study sequential learning procedures for building efficient and effective classifiers , where only the selected subjects are labeled and included in its learning stage .

"we analyze the efficiency of different methods for the calculation of reaction rates in the case of a simple 2d analytical benchmark system .

 we give scaling rules for how this efficiency depends on barrier height and width , and we hand out simple optimization rules for the method - specific parameters . 
 we show that the path sampling methods , using the transition interface sampling technique , become exceedingly more efficient than the others when the reaction coordinate is not the optimal one ."

"motivated by recent experiments on rotating bose - einstein condensates , we investigate a rotating , polarized fermi gas trapped in an anharmonic potential . we apply a semiclassical expansion of the density of states in order to determine how the thermodynamic properties depend on the rotation frequency .

 rotating the gas above a given frequency @xmath0 leads to a ` donut'-shaped cloud which is analogous to the hole found in two - dimensional bose - einstein condensates . 
 the free expansion of the gas after suddenly turning off the trap is considered and characterized by the time and rotation frequency dependence of the aspect ratio .

"theories of stellar orbit diffusion in disk galaxies predict different rates of increase of the velocity dispersions parallel and perpendicular to the disk plane , and it is therefore of interest to measure the different velocity dispersion components in galactic disks of different types . we show that it is possible to extract the three components of the velocity ellipsoid in an intermediate - inclination disk galaxy from measured line - of - sight velocity dispersions on the major and minor axes . on applying the method to observations of the sb galaxy ngc 488 
 , we find evidence for a higher ratio of vertical to radial dispersion in ngc 488 than in the solar neighbourhood of the milky way ( the only other place where this quantity has ever been measured ) . 
 the difference is qualitatively consistent with the notion that spiral structure has been relatively less important in the dynamical evolution of the disk of ngc 488 than molecular clouds .

"a unit disk graph is the intersection graph of @xmath0 congruent disks in the plane . dominating sets in unit disk graphs

 we introduce an @xmath2 algorithm that takes the usual adjacency representation of the graph as input and outputs a @xmath3-approximation . 
 this approximation factor is also attained by a second algorithm , which takes the geometric representation of the graph as input and runs in @xmath4 time regardless of the number of edges .

"a general theory is presented to describe optomechanical interactions of acoustic phonons , having extremely long lifetimes in superfluid @xmath0he , with optical photons in the medium placed in a suitable electromagnetic cavity . 
 the acoustic nonlinearity in the fluid motion is included to consider processes beyond the usual linear process involving absorption or emission of one phonon at a time . 
 we first apply our formulation to the simplest one - phonon process involving the usual resonant anti - stokes upconversion of an incident optical mode . 
 however , when the allowed optical cavity modes are such that there is no single - phonon mode in the superfluid which can give rise to a resonant allowed anti - stokes mode , we must consider the possibility of two - phonon upconversion . 
 for such a case , we show that the two - step two - phonon process could be dominant . 
 we present arguments for large two - step process and negligible single step two - phonon contribution . 
 the two - step process also shows interesting quantum interference among different transition pathways ."

"the rock - paper - scissors ( rps ) game is a widely used model system in game theory . 
 evolutionary game theory predicts the existence of persistent cycles in the evolutionary trajectories of the rps game , but experimental evidence has remained to be rather weak . in this work

 we found strong evidence supporting the existence of persistent cycles . 
 the mean cycling frequency was measured to be @xmath1 period per experimental round . 
 our experimental observations can be quantitatively explained by a simple non - equilibrium model , namely the discrete - time logit dynamical process with a noise parameter .

 if we can add to the present lhc experiments additional detectors which are able to stop the stau particles and measure the produced decay products , the decay characteristics can be studied precisely at the lhc . 
 we identify a maximum `` stopper detector '' that could be added in the cms cavern , and estimate the sensitivity to the lifetime of the stau and to the mass of gravitino with this detector .

 we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that the poggendorff dark ring of conical refraction is confined in three dimensions by regions of higher intensity . 
 we derive the positions of the confining intensity maxima and minima and discuss the application of the poggendorff ring for trapping ultra - cold atoms using the repulsive dipole force of blue - detuned light .

"neutrinos from far - away sources annihilating at the z resonance on relic neutrinos may give origin to the extreme - energy cosmic rays ( eecr ) . if `` z - bursts '' are responsible for the eecr events , then we show that the non - observation of cosmic ray events at energies above 2 @xmath0 ev by the agasa collaboration implies a lower bound @xmath1  ev on the relic neutrino mass . 
 since this mass exceeds the mass - squared differences inferred from oscillation physics , the bound in fact applies to all three neutrino masses . 
 together with the upper bound provided by comparisons of the cmb anisotropy with large - scale structure , this bound leaves only a small interval for neutrino masses around 0.3 ev , if z - bursts are to explain the existing eecr events ."
"the gottesman - knill theorem allows for the efficient simulation of stabilizer - based quantum error - correction circuits . 
 errors in these circuits are commonly modeled as depolarizing channels by using monte carlo methods to insert pauli gates randomly throughout the circuit . although convenient , these channels are poor approximations of common , realistic channels like amplitude damping . here

"we propose a detailed investigation of the schematic mode - coupling approach to experimental data , a method based on the use of simple mode - coupling equations to analyze the dynamics of supercooled liquids . 
 our aim here is to clarify different aspects of this approach that appeared so far uncontrolled or arbitrary , and to validate the results obtained from previous works . analyzing the theoretical foundations of the approach 
 , we first identify the parameters of the theory playing a key role and obtain simple requirements to be met by a schematic model for its use in this context . 
 then we compare the results obtained from the schematic analysis of a given set of experimental data with a variety of models and show that they are all perfectly consistent . 
 a number of potential biases in the method are identified and ruled out by the choice of appropriate models . 
 finally , reference spectra computed from the mode - coupling theory for a model simple liquid are analyzed along the same lines as experimental data , allowing us to show that , despite the strong simplification in the description of the dynamics it involves , the method is free from spurious artifacts and provides accurate estimates of important parameters of the theory .

"exciton - polariton condensates display a variety of intriguing pattern - forming behaviors , particularly when confined in potential traps . 
 it has previously been predicted that triangular lattices of vortices of the same sign will form spontaneously as the result of surface instabilities in a harmonic trap . however , natural disorder , deviation of the external potential from circular symmetry , or higher - order terms modifying the dynamical equations may all have detrimental effects and destabilize the circular trajectories of vortices . here 
 we address these issues , by characterizing the robustness of the vortex lattice against disorder and deformations of the trapping potential . since most experiments use time integrated measurements it would be hard to observe directly the rotating vortex lattices or distinguish them from vortex - free states . 
 we suggest how these difficulties can be overcome and present an experimentally viable interference - imaging scheme that would allow the detection of rotating vortex lattices ."
"radiation pressure dominated accretion discs around compact objects may have turbulent velocities that greatly exceed the electron thermal velocities within the disc . 
 bulk comptonization by the turbulence may therefore dominate over thermal comptonization in determining the emergent spectrum . 
 bulk comptonization by divergenceless turbulence is due to radiation viscous dissipation only . 
 it can be treated as thermal comptonization by solving the kompaneets equation with an equivalent  wave "" temperature , which is a weighted sum over the power present at each scale in the turbulent cascade . 
 bulk comptonization by turbulence with non - zero divergence is due to both pressure work and radiation viscous dissipation . 
 pressure work has negligible effect on photon spectra in the limit of optically thin turbulence , and in this limit radiation viscous dissipation alone can be treated as thermal comptonization with a temperature equivalent to the full turbulent power . in the limit of extremely optically thick turbulence , radiation viscous dissipation is suppressed , and the evolution of local photon spectra can be understood in terms of compression and expansion of the strongly coupled photon and gas fluids . 
 we discuss the consequences of these effects for self - consistently resolving and interpreting turbulent comptonization in spectral calculations in radiation mhd simulations of high luminosity accretion flows .

 our results also suggest that there are some populations of choked ( failed ) sgrbs or low - luminous new types of event . by constructing a model for sgrb 130603b , which is associated with the first kilonova / macronova candidate 
 , we infer that the equation - of - state of neutron stars would be soft enough to provide sufficient ejecta to collimate the jet , if this event was associated with a double neutron star merger ."
"we present a general and powerful , yet simple , class of weighted networks embedded in hidden metric spaces . 
 this class of weighted networks allows an explicit prescription of the joint degree and strength distributions , and the control of the weight distribution and the local disparity of weights by tuning their coupling with the underlying metric space . 
 we present an approach to estimate whether an underlying metric space is needed to explain the weighted features of real networks and show that the model generates networks that reproduce these properties advantageously . 
 the results suggest that the nontrivial weighted structure of real networks could be explained by the coupling between the weights and an underlying metric space , and open the way to the embedding of real weighted networks and to unveiling their natural hidden geometry ."

"we discuss electron spin resonance ( esr ) shifts in spin-1 heisenberg antiferromagnetic chains with a weak single - ion anisotropy , based on several effective field theories : the o(3 ) nonlinear sigma model ( nlsm ) in the haldane phase , free fermion theories around the lower and the upper critical fields . in the o(3 ) nlsm , the single - ion anisotropy corresponds to a composite operator which creates two magnons at the same time and position . 
 therefore , even inside a parameter range where free magnon approximation is valid for thermodynamics , we have to take interactions among magnons into account in order to include the single - ion anisotropy as a perturbation . 
 although the o(3 ) nlsm is only valid in the haldane phase , an appropriate translation of faddeev - zamolodchikov operators of the o(3 ) nlsm to fermion operators enables one to treat esr shifts near the lower critical field in a similar manner to discussions in the haldane phase .

 ced201 is a part of a molecular cloud illuminated by a b9.5v star moving through it at more than 12 km s@xmath0 . 
 the spectra of ced201 give evidence for transformation of very small carbonaceous grains into the carriers of the aromatic infrared bands ( aibs ) , due to the radiation field of the illuminating star and/or to shock waves created by its motion . 
 these very small grains emit mainly very broad bands and a continuum . 
 we suggest that they are present everywhere in the interstellar medium but can only be detected in the mid 
 ir under special circumstances such as those prevailing in this reflection nebula . the efficiency of energy conversion of stellar light into mid 
 infrared emission is 7.5%   for both the very small grains and the aib carriers , and the fraction of interstellar carbon locked in these emitters is approximately 15% ."
"are there two - player games in which a strategy pair can exist as a nash equilibrium only when the game is played quantum mechanically ? to find an answer to this question , we study two - player games that are played in generalized einstein - podolsky - rosen setting . considering particular strategy pairs 
 , we identify sets of games for which the pair can exist as a nash equilibrium when bell s inequality is violated . 
 we thus identify games and players strategies for which the nash inequality becomes equivalent to bell s inequality . as the violation of bell s inequality 
 is regarded as being quantum in nature , this paper thus addresses the earliest criticisms of quantum games that questioned if they were truly quantum ."

 our candidate with the largest proper motion is surprisingly faint and likely to prove interesting : its colors and motions suggest that it might be an m dwarf moving at over 500 km / sec or an l dwarf in the halo ."
"the pulsar wind model is updated by considering the effect of particle density and pulsar death . 
 it can describe both the short term and long term rotational evolution of pulsars consistently . 
 it is applied to model the rotational evolution of the crab pulsar . 
 the pulsar is spun down by a combination of magnetic dipole radiation and particle wind . 
 the parameters of the crab pulsar , including magnetic field , inclination angle , and particle density are calculated . 
 the primary particle density in acceleration region is about @xmath0 times the goldreich - julian charge density . 
 the lower braking index between glitches is due to a larger outflowing particle density 
 . this may be glitch induced magnetospheric activities in normal pulsars . 
 evolution of braking index and the crab pulsar in @xmath1 diagram are calculated . 
 the crab pulsar will evolve from magnetic dipole radiation dominated case towards particle wind dominated case . considering the effect of pulsar `` death '' , the crab pulsar ( and other normal pulsars ) will not evolve to the cluster of magnetars but downwards to the death valley . 
 different acceleration models are also considered . 
 applications to other sources are also discussed , including pulsars with braking index measured , and the magnetar population .

"diffuse 511 kev line emission , from the annihilation of cold positrons , has been observed in the direction of the galactic centre for more than 30 years . 
 the latest high - resolution maps of this emission produced by the spi instrument on integral suggest at least one component of the emission is spatially coincident with the distribution of @xmath070 luminous , low - mass x - ray binaries detected in the soft gamma - ray band . the x - ray band , 
 however , is generally a more sensitive probe of x - ray binary populations . 
 recent x - ray surveys of the galactic centre have discovered a much larger population ( @xmath14000 ) of faint , hard x - ray point sources . 
 we investigate the possibility that the positrons observed in the direction of the galactic centre originate in pair - dominated jets generated by this population of _ fainter _ accretion - powered x - ray binaries . 
 we also consider briefly whether such sources could account for unexplained diffuse emission associated with the galactic centre in the microwave ( the wmap ` haze ' ) and at other wavelengths .

"the sort transform ( st ) is a modification of the burrows - wheeler transform ( bwt ) . 
 both transformations map an arbitrary word of length @xmath0 to a pair consisting of a word of length @xmath0 and an index between @xmath1 and @xmath0 . 
 the bwt sorts all rotation conjugates of the input word , whereas the st of order @xmath2 only uses the first @xmath2 letters for sorting all such conjugates .

"online reviews are often our first port of call when considering products and purchases online . 
 when evaluating a potential purchase , we may have a specific query in mind , e.g. ` will this baby seat fit in the overhead compartment of a 747 ? ' or ` will i like this album if i liked taylor swift s _ 1989 _ ? ' . to answer such questions 
 we must either wade through huge volumes of consumer reviews hoping to find one that is relevant , or otherwise pose our question directly to the community via a q / a system .    in this paper 
 we hope to fuse these two paradigms : given a large volume of previously answered queries about products , we hope to automatically learn whether a review of a product is relevant to a given query . 
 we formulate this as a machine learning problem using a mixture - of - experts - type framework  here 
 each review is an ` expert ' that gets to vote on the response to a particular query ; simultaneously we learn a relevance function such that ` relevant ' reviews are those that vote correctly . at test time 
 this learned relevance function allows us to surface reviews that are relevant to new queries on - demand . 
 we evaluate our system , _ moqa _ , on a novel corpus of 1.4 million questions ( and answers ) and 13 million reviews .

 this setup is inspired by current experiments with quantum gas microscopes , which enable tracking of the impurity motion . 
 we describe the evolution of the impurity motion from quantum wave packet spread at short times , to brownian diffusion at long times . 
 this dynamics is controlled by the interplay between dangerously irrelevant perturbations at the strongly - interacting field theory describing the superfluid - insulator transition in two spatial dimensions ."

"we use bank - level balance sheet data from 2005 to 2010 to study interactions within the banking system of five emerging countries : argentina , brazil , mexico , south africa , and taiwan . for each country 
 we construct a financial network based on the leverage ratio dependence between each pair of banks , and find results that are comparable across countries . 
 banks present a variety of leverage ratio behaviors . 
 this leverage diversity produces financial networks that exhibit a modular structure characterized by one large bank community , some small ones and isolated banks . 
 there exist compact structures that have synchronized dynamics . 
 many groups of banks merge together creating a financial network topology that converges to a unique big cluster at a relatively low leverage dependence level . 
 finally , we propose a model that includes corporate and interbank loans for studying the banking system . 
 this model generates networks similar to the empirical ones . 
 moreover , we find that faster - growing banks tend to be more highly interconnected between them , and this is also observed in empirical data .    # 1#1 :    biblabel#1[#1 ]"
"we set the first limits on the ultra - high energy ( uhe ) neutrino fluence at energies greater than @xmath0  gev from gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) based on data from the second flight of the antarctic impulsive transient antenna ( anita ) . during the 31 day flight of anita - ii ,

 we present a rigorous proof that at convergence this method is guaranteed to preserve lattice and fragment filling . 
 differences arising from fitting the fragment one - particle density matrix alone versus fitting fragment plus bath are scrutinized . 
 we argue that it is important to restrict the density matrix fitting to solely the fragment . 
 furthermore , in the proposed broken symmetry formalism , it is possible to substantially simplify the embedding procedure without sacrificing its accuracy by resorting to _ density _ instead of _ density matrix _ fitting . 
 this simplified density embedding theory ( det ) greatly improves the convergence properties of the algorithm ."
"we develop a theory for light - induced superconductivity in underdoped cuprates in which the competing bond - density wave order is suppressed by driving phonons with light . 
 close to a bond - density wave instability in a system with a small fermi surface , such as a fractionalized fermi liquid , we show that the coupling of electrons to phonons is strongly enhanced at the bond - density wave ordering wavevectors , leading to a strong softening of phonons at these wavevectors . for a model of classical phonons with anharmonic couplings , 
 we show that the combination of strong softening and driving can lead to large phonon oscillations . 
 when coupled to a phenomenological model describing the competition between bond - density wave order and superconductivity , these phonon oscillations melt bond - density wave order , thereby enhancing pairing correlations ."
"social media , regarded as two - layer networks consisting of users and items , turn out to be the most important channels for access to massive information in the era of web 2.0 . 
 the dynamics of human activity and item popularity is a crucial issue in social media networks . in this paper , by analyzing the growth of user activity and item popularity in four empirical social media networks , i.e. , amazon , flickr , delicious and wikipedia , it is found that cross links between users and items are more likely to be created by active users and to be acquired by popular items , where user activity and item popularity are measured by the number of cross links associated with users and items . 
 this indicates that users generally trace popular items , overall . 
 however , it is found that the inactive users more severely trace popular items than the active users . inspired by empirical analysis , we propose an evolving model for such networks , in which the evolution is driven only by two - step random walk . 
 numerical experiments verified that the model can qualitatively reproduce the distributions of user activity and item popularity observed in empirical networks . 
 these results might shed light on the understandings of micro dynamics of activity and popularity in social media networks ."
"in a two - flavor color superconductor , the @xmath0 gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken by diquark condensation . 
 the nambu - goldstone excitations of the diquark condensate mix with the gluons associated with the broken generators of the original gauge group . 
 it is shown how one can decouple these modes with a particular choice of t  hooft gauge . 
 we then explicitly compute the spectral density for transverse and longitudinal gluons of adjoint color 8 . 
 the nambu - goldstone excitations give rise to a singularity in the real part of the longitudinal gluon self - energy . 
 this leads to a vanishing gluon spectral density for energies and momenta located on the dispersion branch of the nambu - goldstone excitations ."
"in this paper , we present a novel approach to model the fluid / solid interaction forces in a direct solver of the navier - stokes equations based on the volume of fluid interface tracking method . the key ingredient of the model is the explicit inclusion of the fluid / solid interaction forces into the governing equations . we show that the interaction forces lead to a partial wetting condition and in particular to a natural definition of the equilibrium contact angle . 
 we present two numerical methods to discretize the interaction forces that enter the model ; these two approaches differ in complexity and convergence . to validate the computational framework 
 , we consider the application of these models to simulate two - dimensional drops at equilibrium , as well as drop spreading . 
 we demonstrate that the model , by including the underlying physics , captures contact line dynamics for arbitrary contact angles . 
 more generally , the approach permits novel means to study contact lines , as well as a diverse range of phenomena that previously could not be addressed in direct simulations ."
"complex networks have been shown to be robust against random structural perturbations , but vulnerable against targeted attacks . 
 robustness analysis usually simulates the removal of individual or sets of nodes , followed by the assessment of the inflicted damage . for complex metabolic networks , it has been suggested that evolutionary pressure may favor robustness against reaction removal . 
 however , the removal of a reaction and its impact on the network may as well be interpreted as selective regulation of pathway activities , suggesting a tradeoff between the efficiency of regulation and vulnerability . here , we employ a cascading failure algorithm to simulate the removal of single and pairs of reactions from the metabolic networks of two organisms , and estimate the significance of the results using two different null models : degree preserving and mass - balanced randomization . 
 our analysis suggests that evolutionary pressure promotes larger cascades of non - viable reactions , and thus favors the ability of efficient metabolic regulation at the expense of robustness ."
"gemini north adaptive optics imaging spectroscopy is presented for the galactic ultra  compact ( ) region k350a . 
 data were obtained in the @xmath0band using the near  infrared integral field spectrograph ( nifs ) behind the facility adaptive optics module altair in natural guide star mode . 
 the nifs data cube reveals a complex spatial morphology across the 0.1 pc scale of the 3@xmath1  region . 
 comparison of the nebular emission to cloudy ionization models shows that the central source must have an effective temperature between about 37000 k and 45000 k with preferred values near 40000 k. evidence is presented for sharp density variations in the nebula which are interpreted as a clearing of material nearest the central source . 
 high excitation lines of  and  show that the ionization of the nebula clearly changes with distance from the central source . 
 a double lobed kinematic signature ( @xmath2 25 ) is evident in the br@xmath3 line map which may be related to the larger scale ionized flow detailed in earlier investigations . 
 this signature and the large scale flow are not co - alighned , but they may still be related . though clearly resolved from the nebula ,

"precision cosmology studies based on wide - field surveys of galaxy clusters benefit from constraints on intrinsic scatter in mass - observable relationships . in principle , two - parameter models combining direct measurements of galaxy cluster structural variation with mass proxies such as x - ray luminosity and temperature can be used to constrain scatter in the relationship between the mass proxy and the cluster s halo mass and to measure the redshift evolution of that scatter . 
 one candidate for quantifying cluster substructure is the icm temperature inhomogeneity inferred from x - ray spectral properties , an example of which is , the ratio of hardband to broadband spectral - fit temperatures . in this paper

"the injection of electrons in the bulk of carbon nanotube which is connected to ideal fermi liquid leads is considered . 
 while the presence of the leads gives a cancellation of the noise cross - correlations , the auto - correlation noise has a fano factor which deviates strongly from the schottky behavior at voltages where finite size effects are expected . 
 indeed , as the voltage is increased from zero , the noise is first super - poissonian , then sub - poissonian , and eventually it reaches the schottky limit . 
 these finite size effects are also tested using a diagnosis of photo - assisted transport , where a small ac modulation is superposed to the dc bias voltage between the injection tip and the nanotube . 
 when finite size effects are at play , we obtain a stepwise behavior for the noise derivative , as expected for normal metal systems , whereas in the absence of finite size effects , due to the presence of coulomb interactions , a smoothed staircase is observed . 
 the present work shows that it is possible to explore finite size effects in nanotube transport via a zero - frequency noise measurement ."
"we report on a long x - ray observation of the slow - rotating binary pulsar gx1 + 4 . 
 _ bepposax _ observed , in the 0.1200kev energy range , an event in which the source flux dropped for almost a day , and then recovered . during this event 
 only the high - energy emission was found to be pulsed and the pulsations were shifted in phase of @xmath0 .

 a broad iron line at @xmath1kev was present outside of the event , where instead two narrow emission lines at @xmath2kev and @xmath3kev were detected . 
 the pulse profile was highly variable as a function of both energy and time .

"we analyze the entanglement between two modes of a free dirac field as seen by two relatively accelerated parties . 
 the entanglement is degraded by the unruh effect and asymptotically reaches a non - vanishing minimum value in the infinite acceleration limit . 
 this means that the state always remains entangled to a degree and can be used in quantum information tasks , such as teleportation , between parties in relative uniform acceleration . 
 we analyze our results from the point of view afforded by the phenomenon of entanglement sharing and in terms of recent results in the area of multi - qubit complementarity ."
"we propose a computational procedure for creating a stable equilibrium triple junction ( tj ) with controlled grain misorientations . 
 we apply this procedure to construct a tj between a @xmath0 grain boundary ( gb ) and two general high - angle gbs in copper , and calculate the diffusion coefficients along the tj and the gbs using molecular dynamics with an embedded - atom potential . 
 the tj diffusion is only a factor of two faster than diffusion in the @xmath1 gb but significantly faster than diffusion in the general gbs . 
 both the gbs and the tj studied here show a premelting behavior near the bulk melting point , where their diffusivities converge to the diffusivity of bulk liquid . 
 although our results are consistent with the common assumption that tj diffusion is generally faster than gb diffusion , the difference between the two diffusivities does not appear to be large enough to ensure a significant contribution of tjs to diffusional creep in polycrystals at high temperatures ."

 the available photonic quantum technology is reaching the state where significant advantages arise for the quantum simulation of interesting questions in heisenberg spin systems . here 
 we experimentally simulate such spin systems with single photons and linear optics . 
 the effective heisenberg - type interactions among individual single photons are realized by quantum interference at the tunable direction coupler followed by the measurement process . 
 the effective interactions are characterized by comparing the entanglement dynamics using pairwise concurrence of a four - photon quantum system . 
 we further show that photonic quantum simulations of generalized heisenberg interactions on a four - site square lattice and a six - site checkerboard lattice are in reach of current technology ."
"we experimentally investigate the phenomenon of a quantum ratchet created by exposing a bose - einstein condensate to short pulses of a potential which is periodic in both space and time . 
 such a ratchet is manifested by a directed current of particles , even though there is an absence of a net bias force . 
 we confirm a recent theoretical prediction [ m. sadgrove and s. wimberger , new j. phys . * 
 11 * , 083027 ( 2009 ) ] that the current direction can be controlled by experimental parameters which leave the underlying symmetries of the system unchanged . 
 we demonstrate that this behavior can be understood using a single variable containing many of the experimental parameters and thus the ratchet current is describable using a single universal scaling law ."
"the galactic center region is expected to host the largest density of dark matter ( dm ) particles within the milky way . 
 then a relatively large gamma - ray signal would be expected from the possible dm particles annihilation ( or decay ) . 
 we are searching for the dm gamma - ray signal from the galactic center , which is also rich in bright discrete gamma - ray sources . 
 furthermore intense diffuse gamma - ray emission due to cosmic - ray interactions with interstellar gas and radiation is detected from the same direction .    a preliminary analysis of the data , taken during the first 11 months of the fermi satellite operations , is reported . 
 the diffuse gamma - ray backgrounds and discrete sources , as we know them today , can account for the large majority of the detected gamma - ray emission from the galactic center . 
 nevertheless a residual emission is left , not accounted for by the above models . 
 an improved model of the galactic diffuse emission and a careful evaluation of new ( possibly unresolved ) sources ( or source populations ) will improve the sensitivity for a dm search ."
"we present an analysis of the close double degenerate nltt12758 , which is comprised of a magnetic white dwarf with a field of about 3.1 mg and an apparently non - magnetic white dwarf . 
 we measured an orbital period of 1.154 days and found that the magnetic white dwarf is spinning around its axis with a period of 23 minutes . 
 an analysis of the atmospheric parameters has revealed that the cooling ages of the two white dwarfs are comparable , suggesting that they formed within a short period of time from each other . 
 our modelling indicates that the non - magnetic white dwarf is more massive ( @xmath0 ) than its magnetic companion ( @xmath1 ) and that the total mass of the system is higher than the chandrasekhar mass .

"we report new observations with the very large array , atacama large millimeter array , and submillimeter array at frequencies from 1.0 to 355 ghz of the galactic center black hole , sagittarius a*. these observations were conducted between october 2012 and november 2014 . 
 while we see variability over the whole spectrum with an amplitude as large as a factor of 2 at millimeter wavelengths , we find no evidence for a change in the mean flux density or spectrum of sgr a * that can be attributed to interaction with the g2 source . 
 the absence of a bow shock at low frequencies is consistent with a cross - sectional area for g2 that is less than @xmath0 @xmath1 . 
 this result fits with several model predictions including a magnetically arrested cloud , a pressure - confined stellar wind , and a stellar photosphere of a binary merger . 
 there is no evidence for enhanced accretion onto the black hole driving greater jet and/or accretion flow emission . 
 finally , we measure the millimeter wavelength spectral index of sgr a * to be flat ; combined with previous measurements , this suggests that there is no spectral break between 230 and 690 ghz . 
 the emission region is thus likely in a transition between optically thick and thin at these frequencies and requires a mix of lepton distributions with varying temperatures consistent with stratification ."
"at low temperatures the phase diagram for the quantum hall effect has a powerful symmetry arising from the law of corresponding states . 
 this symmetry gives rise to an infinite order discrete group which is a generalisation of kramers - wannier duality for the two dimensional ising model . 
 the duality group , which is a subgroup of the modular group , is analysed and it is argued that there is a quantitative difference between a situation in which the spin splitting of electron energy levels is comparable to the cyclotron energy and one in which the spin splitting is much less than the cyclotron energy . in the former case the group of symmetries is larger than in the latter case . 
 these duality symmetries are used to constrain the scaling functions of the theory and , under an assumption of complex meromorphicity , a unique functional form is obtained for the crossover of the conductivities between hall states as a function of the external magnetic field . this analytic form is shown to give good agreement with experimental data . 
 the analysis requires a consideration of the way in which longitudinal resistivities are extracted from the experimentally measured longitudinal resistances and a novel method is proposed for determining the correct normalisation for the former ."

 we consider two different models . in one of them 
 the transport occurs incoherently and is dominated by incoherent tunneling processes of individual excitons , while in the other system no disorder is present and transport processes are fully coherent . 
 we find that the strength of cross correlations of currents in different layers is only insignificantly affected by the disorder and shows up similar behaviour in both systems . 
 we discuss possible experimental realizations and make predictions for measurable quantities ."

 in particular , inverse compton emission from secondary electron - positron pairs and proton synchrotron emission are competitive models for reproducing the hard spectrum of the extra component in grb 090510 . here , using monte carlo simulations , we test the hadronic scenarios against the observed properties . to reproduce the extra component around gev with these models , 
 the proton injection isotropic - equivalent luminosity is required to be larger than @xmath1 erg@xmath2s . 
 such large proton luminosities are a challenge for the hadronic models ."
"an approach , recently proposed to calculate the nucleon generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) in a constituent quark model ( cqm ) scenario , in which the constituent quarks are taken as complex systems , is used to obtain helicity - dependent gpds . 
 they are obtained from the wave functions of the non relativistic cqm of isgur and karl , _ convoluted _ with the helicity - dependent gpds of the constituent quarks themselves . 
 the latter are modelled by using the polarized structure functions of the constituent quark , the double distribution representation of gpds , and a phenomenological constituent quark form factor . 
 the present approach permits to access a kinematical range corresponding to both the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi and the efremov - radyushkin - brodsky - lepage regions , for small values of the momentum transfer and of the skewedness parameter . in this kinematical region 
 , the present calculation represents a prerequisite for the evaluation of cross sections relevant to deeply virtual compton scattering . 
 in particular , we have calculated the leading twist helicity - dependent gpd @xmath0 and , from our expressions , its general relations with the non relativistic definition of the axial form factor and with the leading twist polarized quark density are consistently recovered .

"the recent analysis on noncommutative geometry , showing quantization of the volume for the riemannian manifold entering the geometry , can support a view of quantum mechanics as arising by a stochastic process on it . 
 a class of stochastic processes can be devised , arising as fractional powers of an ordinary wiener process , that reproduce in a proper way a stochastic process on a noncommutative geometry . 
 these processes are characterized by producing complex values and so , the corresponding fokker  planck equation resembles the schrdinger equation . indeed , by a direct numerical check , one can recover the kernel of the schrdinger equation starting by an ordinary brownian motion . 
 this class of stochastic processes needs a clifford algebra to exist . in four dimensions , 
 the full set of dirac matrices is needed and the corresponding stochastic process in a noncommutative geometry is easily recovered as is the dirac equation in the klein 
 gordon form being it the fokker 
 planck equation of the process ."
"a statistical scenario is proposed to explain the @xmath0-ray variability and flares of the crab nebula , which were observed recently by the fermi / lat . in this scenario electrons 
 are accelerated in a series of knots , whose sizes follow a power - law distribution . 
 these knots presumably move outwards from the pulsar and have a distribution in the doppler boost factor . 
 the maximal electron energy is assumed to be proportional to the size of the knot . 
 fluctuations at the highest energy end of the overall electron distribution will result in variable @xmath0-ray emission via the synchrotron process in the @xmath1 mev range . 
 since highly boosted larger knots are rarer than smaller knots , the model predicts that the variability of the synchrotron emission increases with the photon energy . 
 we realize such a scenario with a monte - carlo simulation and find that the model can reproduce both the two @xmath0-ray flares over a period of @xmath2 year and the monthly scale @xmath0-ray flux fluctuations as observed by the fermi / lat . 
 the observed @xmath0-ray spectra in both the steady and flaring states are also well reproduced ."
"comparison of the observed evolution of the ly - alpha transmitted flux in the spectra of four highest redshift quasars discovered by sloan survey with the theoretical prediction for this evolution based on the state - of - the - art numerical simulations of cosmological reionization already allows one to constrain the redshift of reionization to @xmath0 , where systematic and random errors are given respectively .

"we have analyzed available optical data for au in the mid - infrared range which is important for a precise prediction of the casimir force . 
 significant variation of the data demonstrates genuine sample dependence of the dielectric function . 
 we demonstrate that the casimir force is largely determined by the material properties in the low frequency domain and argue that therefore the precise values of the drude parameters are crucial for an accurate evaluation of the force . 
 these parameters can be estimated by two different methods , either by fitting real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function at low frequencies , or via a kramers - kronig analysis based on the imaginary part of the dielectric function in the extended frequency range . 
 both methods lead to very similar results . 
 we show that the variation of the casimir force calculated with the use of different optical data can be as large as 5% and at any rate can not be ignored . to have a reliable prediction of the force with a precision of 1% , one has to measure the optical properties of metallic films used for the force measurement ."
"we present the first investigation of the blue straggler star ( bss ) population in two isolated dwarf spheroidal galaxies of the local group , cetus and tucana . 
 deep hst / acs photometry allowed us to identify samples of 940 and 1214 candidates , respectively . 
 the analysis of the star formation histories of the two galaxies suggests that both host a population of bsss . 
 specifically , if the bss candidates are interpreted as young main sequence stars , they do not conform to their galaxy s age - metallicity relationship . 
 the analysis of the luminosity function and the radial distributions support this conclusion , and suggest a non - collisional mechanism for the bss formation , from the evolution of primordial binaries . 
 this scenario is also supported by the results of new dynamical simulations presented here . 
 both galaxies coincide with the relationship between the bss frequency and the absolute visual magnitude m@xmath0 found by @xcite . 
 if this relationship is confirmed by larger sample , then it could be a valuable tool to discriminate between the presence of bsss and galaxies hosting truly young populations ."
"an evolution of luminosity of galaxies in emission lines or wavelength ranges in which they are sensitive to the star formation process is caused by burning out of the most massive o - class stars during a few million years after a starburst . 
 we study the impact of this effect on the luminosity function ( lf ) of a sample of star - forming galaxies . 
 we introduce several types of lfs : an initial lf after a starburst , current , time - averaged and sample ones . 
 we find the relations between them in general and specify them in the case of the luminosity evolution law proposed for the luminous compact galaxies . 
 we obtain the sample lf for the cases the initial one is described by the pure schechter function or the log - normal distribution and analyze the properties of these lfs . as a result we get two new types of lfs to fit the lf of a sample of star - forming galaxies ."
"in this paper we address the topic of inelastic electron scattering in mesoscopic quantum transport . for systems where only elastic scattering is present , landauer theory provides an adequate description of transport that relates the electronic current to single - particle transmission and reflection probabilities . 
 a formalism proposed recently by bon@xmath0a and trugman facilitates the calculation of the one - electron transmission and reflection probabilities for _ inelastic _ processes in mesoscopic conductors connected to one - dimensional ideal leads . building on their work 
 , we have developed a self - consistent procedure for the evaluation of the non - equilibrium electron distributions in ideal leads connecting such mesoscopic conductors to electron reservoirs at finite temperatures and voltages . 
 we evaluate the net electronic current flowing through the mesoscopic device by utilizing these non - equilibrium distributions . 
 our approach is a generalization of landauer theory that takes account of the pauli exclusion principle for the various competing elastic and inelastic processes while satisfying the requirement of particle conservation . as an application 
 we examine the influence of elastic and inelastic scattering on conduction through a two site molecular wire with longitudinal phonons using the su - schrieffer - heeger model of electron - phonon coupling ."

"we consider the following _ network computation problem_. in an acyclic network , there are multiple source nodes , each generating multiple messages , and there are multiple sink nodes , each demanding a function of the source messages . 
 the network coding problem corresponds to the case in which every demand function is equal to some source message , i.e. , each sink demands some source message . 
 connections between network coding problems and matroids have been well studied . in this work , 
 we establish a relation between network computation problems and representable matroids . 
 we show that a network computation problem in which the sinks demand linear functions of source messages admits a scalar linear solution if and only if it is matroidal with respect to a representable matroid whose representation fulfills certain constraints dictated by the network computation problem . 
 next , we obtain a connection between network computation problems and functional dependency relations ( fd - relations ) and show that fd - relations can be used to characterize network computation problem with arbitrary ( not necessarily linear ) function demands as well as nonlinear network codes ."

"it has recently been suggested that collapse of neutron stars induced by a phase transition to quark matter can be a considerable source of gravitational waves with khz frequencies . 
 we demonstrate that if about one percent of all neutron stars undergo this process , the resulting cosmological gravitational wave background would reach about @xmath0 times the critical density . 
 the background would peak at khz frequencies and could have an observationally significant tail down to hz frequencies . 
 it would be comparable or higher than other astrophysical backgrounds , for example , from ordinary core collapse supernovae , from r - mode instabilities in rapidly rotating neutron stars , or from magnetars . 
 the scenario is consistent with cosmological backgrounds in neutrinos and photons .

"within the framework of boltzmann transport equation with a bhatnagar - gross - krook ( bgk ) collisional kernel , we study the wake potential induced by fast partons traveling through the high - temperature qcd plasma which is anisotropic in momentum - space .

 the wake potential for various combinations of the anisotropy parameter ( @xmath0 ) and the collision rate ( @xmath1 ) is evaluated both for parallel and perpendicular directions of motion of the fast parton .

"a new conceptual key generation scheme is presented by using intrinsic quantum correlations of single photons between alice and bob . 
 the intrinsic bi - partite correlation functions allow key bit to be generated through high level communication language i.e. a key bit is directly encoded to shared correlation functions not to the state and detection of a photon at bob does not mean key bit . 
 these make the scheme robust against intercept - resend attack because alice and bob can always check the errors in their measurements and reveal the presence of eve in their channel without leaking any key bit information . 
 the scheme is strictly relied on the perfect beam splitter and mean photon number less than 1 , where more than one photon in a coherent pulse will introduce more errors in bob even without the presence of eve . from the percentage of errors in bob 
 , we can estimate the amount of information will be leaked to eve in the photon - number splitting attack . 
 this scheme can preserve the randomness of phase - randomized light source for doubling the communication distance as in original ekert s protocol and providing the raw key generation rate a factor of 2 higher than weak coherent light protocols ."
"the hypothesis that living systems can benefit from operating at the vicinity of critical points has gained momentum in recent years . 
 criticality may confer an optimal balance between too ordered and exceedingly noisy states . here 
 we present a model , based on information theory and statistical mechanics , illustrating how and why a community of agents aimed at understanding and communicating with each other converges to a globally coherent state in which all individuals are close to an internal critical state , i.e. at the borderline between order and disorder . 
 we study both analytically and computationally the circumstances under which criticality is the best possible outcome of the dynamical process , confirming the convergence to critical points under very generic conditions . 
 finally , we analyze the effect of cooperation ( agents trying to enhance not only their fitness , but also that of other individuals ) and competition ( agents trying to improve their own fitness and to diminish those of competitors ) within our setting . 
 the conclusion is that , while competition fosters criticality , cooperation hinders it and can lead to more ordered or more disordered consensual outcomes ."

 it is shown that for large classes of locally convex model spaces ( containing frchet spaces and duals of frchet - schwartz spaces ) , the three definitions are actually equivalent . 
 the equivalence of the definition via charts with the definition via ringed spaces is based on the fact that for the classes of model spaces under consideration , smoothness of maps turns out to be equivalent to their _ scalarwise smoothness _ ( that is , the smoothness of their composition with smooth real - valued functions ) . +"

 tip interacts mostly with electrons with cyclotron trajectories passing directly underneath it , leaving a trail of modified current density behind it . 
 other ( indirect ) trajectories become relevant when the tip is placed near the edges of the sample , and current is scattered between the tip and the edge . 
 we also discuss possible explanations for spatial asymmetry of experimentally measured resistance maps , and connect it with specific configurations of the measuring probes ."
"we study the statistical properties of the 1st year wmap data on different scales using the spherical mexican hat wavelet transform .

 this paper extends the work of vielva et al . as follows . 
 we find that the non - gaussian signal shows up more strongly in the form of a larger than expected number of cold pixels and also in the form of scale - scale correlations amongst wavelet coefficients . 
 we establish the robustness of the non - gaussian signal under more wide - ranging assumptions regarding the galactic mask applied to the data and the noise statistics . 
 this signal is unlikely to be due to the usual quadratic term parametrized by the non - linearity parameter @xmath1 .

"weak gravitational lensing causes subtle changes in the apparent shapes of galaxies due to the bending of light by the gravity of foreground masses . by measuring the shapes of large numbers of galaxies ( millions in recent surveys , up to tens of billions in future surveys ) we can infer the parameters that determine cosmology . 
 imperfections in the detectors used to record images of the sky can introduce changes in the apparent shape of galaxies , which in turn can bias the inferred cosmological parameters . in this paper 
 we consider the effect of two widely discussed sensor imperfections : tree - rings , due to impurity gradients which cause transverse electric fields in the charge - coupled devices ( ccd ) , and pixel - size variation , due to periodic ccd fabrication errors . 
 these imperfections can be observed when the detectors are subject to uniform illumination ( flat field images ) . 
 we develop methods to determine the spurious shear and convergence ( due to the imperfections ) from the flat - field images . 
 we calculate how the spurious shear when added to the lensing shear will bias the determination of cosmological parameters . 
 we apply our methods to candidate sensors of the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) as a timely and important example , analyzing flat field images recorded with lsst prototype ccds in the laboratory . 
 we find that tree - rings and periodic pixel - size variation present in the lsst ccds will introduce negligible bias to cosmological parameters determined from the lensing power spectrum , specifically @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ."

"we examine the star - forming history ( sfh ) of the m31 disk during the past few hundred myr . the luminosity functions ( lfs ) of main sequence stars at distances r@xmath0 kpc ( i.e. @xmath1 disk scale lengths ) are matched by models that assume a constant star formation rate ( sfr ) . 
 however , at smaller r@xmath2 the lfs suggest that during the past @xmath3 myr the sfr was @xmath4 higher than during the preceding @xmath5 myr . 
 the rings of cool gas that harbor a significant fraction of the current star - forming activity are traced by stars with ages @xmath5 myr , indicating that ( 1 ) these structures have ages of at least 100 myr , and ( 2 ) stars in these structures do not follow the same relation between age and random velocity as their counterparts throughout the disks of other spiral galaxies , probably due to the inherently narrow orbital angular momentum distribution of the giant molecular clouds in these structures . 
 the distribution of evolved red stars is not azimuthally symmetric , in the sense that their projected density along the north east segment of the major axis is roughly twice that on the opposite side of the galaxy . 
 the north east arm of the major axis thus appears to be a fossil star - forming area that dates to intermediate epochs . 
 such a structure may be the consequence of interactions with a companion galaxy .

"the conventional picture for the origin of the polarization of a supernova is based on a model of thomson or resonance scattering of photons traveling through an aspherical supernova atmosphere . 
 positive detection of intrinsic polarization in sn 1987a is then interpretated as evidence of an asymmetrical supernova atmosphere . 
 we show here a different view based on the scattering of the supernova light by a dusty circumstellar material ( csm ) , or the `` light echo '' effect . at a given epoch after the explosion , the observed photons consist of both those propagating directly from the supernova and those scattered by dust particles in the csm . 
 polarized light can be produced if the distribution of the dust particles is aspherical . 
 the model can reproduce both the time evolution of the observed broad band polarization of sn 1987a and major features of the polarization spectra . 
 it is also successful in providing a natural model for the early infrared light curve , in particular the observed 30 day delay of the ir maximum compared to the maximum of the bolometric light curve .

"the eigenvalue structure of the quantum transfer matrix is known to encode essential information about the elementary excitations . here 
 we study transfer matrices of quantum states in a topological phase using the tensor network formalism . 
 we demonstrate that topological quantum order requires a particular type of ` symmetry breaking ' for the fixed point subspace of the transfer matrix , and relate physical anyon excitations to domain wall excitations at the level of the transfer matrix . a topological phase transition to a trivial phase 
 triggers a change in the fixed point subspace to either a larger or smaller symmetry and we explain how this relates to a condensation or confinement of the corresponding anyon sectors . 
 the tensor network formalism enables us to determine the structure of the topological sectors in two - dimensional gapped phases very efficiently , therefore opening novel avenues for studying fundamental open questions related to anyon condensation ."

"the universal secure network coding presented by silva et al . realizes secure and reliable transmission of a secret message over any underlying network code , by using maximum rank distance codes .

 the security performance and error correction capability are said to be _ universal _ when they are independent of underlying network codes . 
 this paper introduces new code parameters , the relative dimension / intersection profile ( rdip ) and the relative generalized rank weight ( rgrw ) of linear codes .

 side resonances separated by around 130 mhz are due to hyperfine coupling between nv@xmath0 centers and nearest - neighbor @xmath1c nuclear spins . 
 side resonances separated by approximately \{40 , 260 , 300 } mhz are found to originate from simultaneous spin flipping of nv@xmath0 centers and single substitutional nitrogen atoms . 
 all results are in agreement with the presented theoretical calculations ."
"a warm fermionic ads star under a homogeneous magnetic field is explored . 
 we obtain the relativistic landau levels by using dirac equation and use the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff  ( tov ) equation to study the physical profiles of the star . 
 bulk properties such as sound speed , adiabatic index , and entropy density within the star are calculated analytically and numerically . 
 bulk temperature increases the mass limit of the ads star but external magnetic field has the opposite effect . 
 the results are partially interpreted in terms of the pre - thermalization process of the gauge matter at the ads boundary after the mass injection . 
 the entropy density is found to demonstrate similar temperature dependence as the magnetic black brane in the ads in certain limits regardless of the different nature of the bulk and hawking temperatures . 
 total entropy of the ads star is also found to be an increasing function of the bulk temperature and a decreasing function of the magnetic field , similar behaviour to the mass limit . 
 since both total entropy and mass limit are global quantities , they could provide some hints to the value of entropy and energy of the dual gauge matter before and during the thermalization .

"we illustrate the mass and charge renormalization procedures in quantum field theory using , as an example , a simple model of interacting electrons and photons . it is shown how addition of infinite renormalization counterterms to the hamiltonian helps to obtain finite and accurate results for the @xmath0-matrix . in order to remove the ultraviolet divergences from the hamiltonian 
 , we apply the greenberg - schweber `` dressing transformation '' and the gazek - wilson `` similarity renormalization '' . 
 the resulting `` dressed particle '' hamiltonian is finite in all orders of the perturbation theory and yields accurate @xmath0-matrix and bound state energies . 
 the bare and virtual particles are removed from the theory , and physical dressed particles interact via direct action - at - a - distance ."
"using a direct simulation monte carlo technique , we have studied the time evolution of a cold atom cloud interacting with a time dependent radio frequency ( rf ) dressed state potential . 
 exposure of a cloud of @xmath0 atoms , trapped in a quadrupole magnetic trap , to a time dependent rf - field with increasing amplitude and decreasing frequency , shows a variation in the number of trapped atoms and the overall shape of the atom cloud . 
 it is shown by simulations that , initially at lower rf - field strength , the rf - field results in ejection of atoms from the trap , leading to evaporative cooling of the atom cloud . 
 later , at higher rf - field strength , the atoms undergo the non - adiabatic landau - zener ( lz ) transitions , which leads to their trapping in an rf - dressed state potential of toroidal shape . 
 the results of simulations explain the experimentally observed results . 
 the simulations can be useful to predict the atom cloud dynamics and trapping geometries with other forms of the potential ."
"we consider a bose - einstein condensate confined in a `` mexican hat '' potential , with a quartic minus quadratic radial dependence . 
 we find conditions under which the ground state is annular in shape , with a hole in the center of the condensate . 
 rotation leads to the appearance of stable multiply - quantized vortices , giving rise to a superfluid flow around the ring . 
 the collective modes of the system are explored both numerically and analytically using the gross - pitaevskii and hydrodynamic equations . 
 potential experimental schemes to detect vorticity are proposed and evaluated , which include measuring the splitting of collective mode frequencies , observing expansion following release from the trap , and probing the momentum distribution of the condensate ."
"although observations of circumstellar shock interactions around supernovae are generally consistent with a @xmath0 wind surrounding the progenitor star , this is not true for grb ( gamma - ray burst ) afterglows . 
 however , grb 991208 and grb 000301c may be consistent with wind interaction if the injection particle spectrum is a broken power law . 
 circumstellar dust echos can place constraints on supernova and grb progenitors , but have been clearly observed only around sn 1987a . 
 excess emission observed in two grb afterglows is more likely to have a supernova origin . 
 an interstellar dust echo , causing the light curve to flatten out , is a possibility for grb afterglows , but is not likely to be observable ."
"we examine linear and quasi - liner stages of cherenkov - drift instability in the relativistic magnetized electron - positron plasma . 
 the external magnetic field lines are assumed to be slightly curved . in this case 
 the curvature drift of relativistic beam particles plays decisive role in the development of the instability . 
 quasi - linear relaxation of the relativistic beam leads to diffusion of the resonant particles in the momenta space . 
 the expressions for diffusion coefficients of cherenkov - drift instability are obtained ."
"this work advocates eulerian motion representation learning over the current standard lagrangian optical flow model .

 for each task we motivate the phase - based direction and provide a possible approach ."
"we examine the local density of states of an impurity level or a quantum dot coupled to a fractional quantum hall edge , or to the end of a single one - dimensional luttinger - liquid lead . 
 effects of an ohmic dissipative bath are also taken into account . using both analytical and numerical techniques 
 we show that , in general , the density of states exhibits power - law frequency dependence near the fermi energy . in a substantial region of the parameter space 
 it simply reflects the behavior of the tunneling density of states at the end of a luttinger - liquid , and is insensitive either to the value of the dot - lead interaction or to the strength of dissipation ; otherwise it depends on these couplings too . 
 this behavior should be contrasted with the thermodynamic properties of the level , in particular , its occupancy , which were previously shown to depend on the various interactions in the system only through the corresponding fermi edge singularity exponent , and thus can not display any luttinger - liquid specific power - law . 
 hence , we can construct different models , some with and some without interactions in the wire ( but with equal fermi edge singularity exponents ) , which would have very different level densities of states , although they all result in the same level population vs.  energy curves ."

"understanding customer buying patterns is of great interest to the retail industry and has shown to benefit a wide variety of goals ranging from managing stocks to implementing loyalty programs . 
 association rule mining is a common technique for extracting correlations such as _ people in the south of france buy ros wine _ or _ 
 customers who buy pat also buy salted butter and sour bread . _ unfortunately , sifting through a high number of buying patterns is not useful in practice , because of the predominance of popular products in the top rules . as a result , 
 a number of `` interestingness '' measures ( over 30 ) have been proposed to rank rules . 
 however , there is no agreement on which measures are more appropriate for retail data . 
 moreover , since pattern mining algorithms output thousands of association rules for each product , the ability for an analyst to rely on ranking measures to identify the most interesting ones is crucial . in this paper , 
 we develop  ( comparative analysis of patterns ) , a framework that provides analysts with the ability to compare the outcome of interestingness measures applied to buying patterns in the retail industry .

"we study the impact of the halo shape and geometry on the expected weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dark matter annihilation signal from the galactic center . as the halo profile in the innermost region is still poorly constrained , we focus on geometrical distortions and consider different density behaviors like flat cores , cusps and spikes . we show that asphericity has a strong impact on the annihilation signal when the halo profile near the galactic center is flat , but becomes gradually less significant for cuspy profiles , and negligible in the presence of a central spike 
 . however , the astrophysical factor is strongly dependent on the wimp mass and annihilation cross - section in the latter case ."
"3ex    * abstract *    in this paper , we discuss a possibility of studying properties of dark energy in long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments . 
 we consider two types of models of neutrino dark energy . 
 for one type of models the scalar field is taken to be quintessence - like and for the other phantom - like . in these models 
 the scalar fields couple to the neutrinos to give rise to a spatially varying neutrino masses . 
 we will show that the two types of models predict different behaviors of the spatial variation of the neutrino masses inside earth and consequently result in different signals in long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments ."
"we report results important for the creation of a best - of - both - worlds quantum hybrid system consisting of a solid - state source of single photons and an atomic ensemble as quantum memory . 
 we generate single photons from a gaas quantum dot ( qd ) frequency - matched to the rb d2-transitions and then use the rb transitions to analyze spectrally the quantum dot photons . 
 we demonstrate lifetime - limited qd linewidths ( 1.42 ghz ) with both resonant and non - resonant excitation . 
 the qd resonance fluorescence in the low power regime is dominated by rayleigh scattering , a route to match quantum dot and rb atom linewidths and to shape the temporal wave packet of the qd photons . 
 noise in the solid - state environment is relatively benign : there is a blinking of the resonance fluorescence at mhz rates but negligible dephasing of the qd excitonic transition . 
 we therefore demonstrate significant progress towards the realization of an ideal solid - state source of single photons at a key wavelength for quantum technologies ."

"_ ab initio _ calculations within the density - functional theory formalism are performed to investigate the chemical functionalization of a graphene - like monolayer of silicon  silicene  with b , n , al or p atoms . 
 the structural , electronic , magnetic and vibrational properties are reported . 
 the most preferable adsorption sites are found to be valley , bridge , valley and hill site for b , n , al and p adatoms , respectively . all the relaxed systems with adsorbed 
 / substituted atoms exhibit metallic behaviour with strongly bonded b , n , al , and p atoms accompanied by an appreciable electron transfer from silicene to the b , n and p adatom / substituent . 
 the al atoms exhibit opposite charge transfer , with n - type doping of silicene and weaker bonding . 
 the adatoms / substituents induce characteristic branches in the phonon spectrum of silicene , which can be probed by raman measurements . using molecular dynamics we found that the systems under study are stable up to at least t = 500 k.

"the galactic cosmic rays are the main source of ionization in the earth stratosphere and troposphere . 
 the induced by primary cosmic ray particles ionization is important in various processes related to atmospheric physics and chemistry , specifically the minor constituents . 
 the ion production in the atmosphere is enhanced compared to the average following major solar energetic particles events , specifically over the polar caps . during the solar cycle 23 we observed several strong ground level enhancements , one of the strongest among them been the bastille day event on 14 july 2000 . in the work presented here 
 we apply a full monte carlo 3-d model in order to compute the cosmic ray induced ionization . 
 the model is based on atmospheric shower simulation with the planetocosmics code and the ion production rate is considered as a superposition of cosmic rays with galactic and solar origin . 
 the ion production rate is computed as a function of the altitude above the sea level and the short , mid and long term ionization effect relative to the average due to galactic cosmic rays is computed ."
"a soap film , or a flexible membrane without bending and torsional stiffness , that is confined in a cylinder is shown to be susceptible to a surface - tension - driven instability when it is stretched or twisted . 
 this leads to its breakdown and places an upper limit on the aspect ratio of such structures . 
 a simple analysis confirms the values for the critical aspect ratio of the stretched film found in both simulations and experiments on soap films , and this threshold decreases with increasing twist of the film ."
"we assume that the helium - i lines emitted by the massive binary system @xmath0 carinae are formed in the acceleration zone of the less - massive secondary star .

 the acceptable binary eccentricity is in the range @xmath2 , and the inclination angle ( the angle between a line perpendicular to the orbital plane and the line of sight ) is in the range @xmath3 . 
 lower values of @xmath4 require higher values of @xmath5 , and vice versa . 
 the binary system is oriented such that the secondary star is in our direction ( closer to us ) during periastron passage .

"we propose an efficient strategy to infer sparse hopfield network based on magnetizations and pairwise correlations measured through glauber samplings . 
 this strategy incorporates the @xmath0 regularization into the bethe approximation by a quadratic approximation to the log - likelihood , and is able to further reduce the inference error of the bethe approximation without the regularization . 
 the optimal regularization parameter is observed to be of the order of @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of independent samples . 
 the value of the scaling exponent depends on the performance measure . 
 @xmath3 for root mean squared error measure while @xmath4 for misclassification rate measure . 
 the efficiency of this strategy is demonstrated for the sparse hopfield model , but the method is generally applicable to other diluted mean field models . in particular , it is simple in implementation without heavy computational cost ."
"we demonstrate that the observed distribution of ` hot neptune'/`super - earth ' systems is well reproduced by a model in which planet assembly occurs in situ , with no significant migration post - assembly . 
 this is achieved only if the amount of mass in rocky material is @xmath0@xmath1 interior to 1  au . 
 such a reservoir of material implies that significant radial migration of solid material takes place , and that it occur before the stage of final planet assembly . 
 the model not only reproduces the general distribution of mass versus period , but also the detailed statistics of multiple planet systems in the sample . 
 we furthermore demonstrate that cores of this size are also likely to meet the criterion to gravitationally capture gas from the nebula , although accretion is rapidly limited by the opening of gaps in the gas disk . if the mass growth is limited by this tidal truncation , then the scenario sketched here naturally produces neptune - mass objects with substantial components of both rock and gas , as is observed . 
 the quantitative expectations of this scenario are that most planets in the ` hot neptune / super - earth ' class inhabit multiple - planet systems , with characteristic orbital spacings . 
 the model also provides a natural division into gas - rich ( hot neptune ) and gas - poor ( super - earth ) classes at fixed period . the dividing mass ranges from @xmath2 at 10  day orbital periods to @xmath3 at 100  day orbital periods . for orbital periods @xmath4  days , the division is less clear because a gas atmosphere may be significantly eroded by stellar radiation ."

 the correlation between v , r , and i is also analyzed using the dcf ( discrete correlation function ) method .

"the transition metal dichalcogenide ( tmd ) @xmath0-tas@xmath1 exhibits a rich set of charge density wave ( cdw ) orders . 
 recent investigations suggested that using light or electric field can manipulate the commensurate ( c ) cdw ground state . 
 such manipulations are considered to be determined by the charge carrier doping . here 
 we simulate by first - principles calculations the carrier doping effect on ccdw in @xmath0-tas@xmath1 . 
 we investigate the charge doping effects on the electronic structures and phonon instabilities of @xmath0 structure and analyze the doping induced energy and distortion ratio variations in ccdw structure . 
 we found that both in bulk and monolayer @xmath0-tas@xmath1 , ccdw is stable upon electron doping , while hole doping can significantly suppress the ccdw , implying different mechanisms of such reported manipulations . 
 light or positive perpendicular electric field induced hole doping increases the energy of ccdw , so that the system transforms to nccdw or similar metastable state . on the other hand , 
 even the ccdw distortion is more stable upon in - plain electric field induced electron injection , some accompanied effects can drive the system to cross over the energy barrier from ccdw to nearly commensurate ( nc ) cdw or similar metastable state . 
 we also estimate that hole doping can introduce potential superconductivity with @xmath2 of @xmath3 k. controllable switching of different states such as ccdw / mott insulating state , metallic state , and even the superconducting state can be realized in @xmath0-tas@xmath1 , which makes the novel material have very promising applications in the future electronic devices ."
"the in - medium properties of the vector mesons are known to be modified significantly in hot and dense hadronic matter due to vacuum polarisation effects from the baryon sector in the walecka model . 
 the vector meson mass drops significantly in the medium due to the effects of the dirac sea . in the variational approach adopted in the present paper , 
 these effects are taken into account through a realignment of the ground state with baryon condensates . 
 such a realignment of the ground state becomes equivalent to summing of the baryonic tadpole diagrams in the relativistic hartree approximation ( rha ) . 
 the approximation scheme adopted here goes beyond rha to include quantum effects from the scalar meson and is nonperturbative and self  consistent . 
 it includes multiloop effects , thus corresponding to a different approximation as compared to the one loop approximation of including scalar field quantum corrections . in the present work , 
 we study the properties of the vector mesons in the hot and dense matter as modified due to such quantum correction effects from the baryon as well as scalar meson sectors . 
 these medium modifications of the properties of the vector mesons are reflected , through the shifting and broadening of the respective peaks , in the low mass dilepton spectra . 
 there is broadening of the peaks due to corrections from scalar meson quantum effects as compared to the relativistic hartree approximation . 
 it is seen to be rather prominent for the @xmath0 meson in the invariant mass plot .

 stabilization over the unpolarized phase is obtained by splitting one flat @xmath0-type band crossing the fermi energy . 
 comparison with crn reveals that the magnetic ordering of crn , which consists of double - ferromagnetic sheets compensating along the [ 110 ] direction of the cubic cell and stabilized by the distortion of the squared symmetry on ( 100 ) plane , is not effective for fen .

"the compositions of nascent planets depend on the compositions of their birth disks . 
 in particular , the elemental compositions of gas giant gaseous envelopes depend on the elemental composition of the disk gas from which the envelope is accreted . 
 previous models demonstrated that sequential freeze - out of o and c - bearing volatiles in disks will result in an supersolar c / o ratios and subsolar c / h ratios in the gas between water and co snowlines . 
 this result does not take into account , however , the expected grain growth and radial drift of pebbles in disks , and the accompanying re - distribution of volatiles from the outer to the inner disk . using a toy model 
 we demonstrate that when drift is considered , co is enhanced between the water and co snowline , resulting in both supersolar c / o and c / h ratios in the disk gas in the gas giant formation zone . 
 this result appears robust to the details of the disk model as long as there is substantial pebble drift across the co snowline , and the efficiency of co vapor diffusion is limited . 
 gas giants that accrete their gaseous envelopes exterior to the water snowline and do not experience substantial core - envelope mixing , may thus present both superstellar c / o and c / h ratios in their atmospheres . 
 pebble drift will also affect the nitrogen and noble gas abundances in the planet forming zones , which may explain some of jupiter s peculiar abundance patterns ."

 this system behaves alike an anti - ferromagnetic kinetic ising model . within a wide region of social dilemmas 
 this dynamical rule supports the formation of similar spatial arrangement of the cooperators and defectors ensuring the optimum total payoff if the temptation to choose defection exceeds a threshold value dependent on the sucker s payoff . 
 the comparison of the results with those achieved for pairwise imitation and myopic strategy updates has indicated the relevant advantage of pairwise collective strategy update in the maintenance of cooperation ."

"we have detected an x - ray flare on the very low mass star vb 10 ( gl 752 b ; m8 v ) using the rosat high resolution imager . 
 vb 10 is the latest type ( lowest mass ) main sequence star known to exhibit coronal activity . 
 x - rays were detected from the star during a single 1.1-ksec segment of an observation which lasted 22 ksec in total . 
 the energy released by this flare is on the order of @xmath0 ergs s@xmath1 . 
 this is at least two orders of magnitude greater than the quiescent x - ray luminosity of vb 10 , which has yet to be measured . 
 this x - ray flare is very similar in nature to the far ultraviolet flare which was observed by linsky et al . 
 ( 1995 ) using the goddard high resolution spectrograph onboard the hubble space telescope . 
 we discuss reasons for the extreme difference between the flare and quiescent x - ray luminosities , including the possibility that vb 10 has no quiescent ( @xmath2 k ) coronal plasma at all ."
"the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) has been used to map class  i methanol masers at 36 and 44  ghz in g309.38@xmath00.13 . 
 maser spots are found at nine locations in an area of 50@xmath130 , with both transitions reliably detected at only two locations . 
 the brightest spot is associated with shocked gas traced by 4.5-@xmath2 m emission . 
 the data allowed us to make a serendipitous discovery of a high - velocity 36-ghz spectral feature , which is blue - shifted by about 30  km  s@xmath3 from the peak velocity at this frequency , but spatially located close to ( within a few arcseconds of ) the brightest maser spot . 
 we interpret this as indicating an outflow parallel to the line of sight . 
 such a high velocity spread of maser features , which has not been previously reported in the class  i methanol masers associated with a single molecular cloud , suggests that the outflow most likely interacts with a moving parcel of gas .

"historically , ge has been considered as a neutron - capture element . in this case , the r - process abundance of ge is derived through subtracting the s - process abundance from total abundance of the solar system . however ,

 the transition is confirmed by the timing analysis presented in this work , which reveals that a weak type - a quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) replaces a strong type - c qpo . at the same time , spectral analysis shows that the flux of the high - energy component shows a significant decrease in its flux . 
 however , we observe a delay ( roughly one day ) between variations of the spectral parameters of the high - energy component and changes in the flux and timing properties .

"ngc5905 is one of the very few galaxies that underwent a giant x - ray outburst , with a change in photon countrate of a factor @xmath0100 . 
 the outburst spectrum is both , very soft and luminous ( bade , komossa & dahlem 1996 ) . 
 our high - resolution follow - up optical spectroscopy of ngc5905 does not reveal any signs of seyfert activity . at present , this makes ngc 5905 the _ only _ non - active galaxy among the x - ray outbursting ones . 
 we discuss several scenarios to account for the exceptional properties of ngc5905 , including a supernova in dense medium , an accretion - disk instability , an event of extreme gravitational lensing , and the x - ray afterglow of a grb to account for the x - ray outburst . 
 we find that the most likely model to explain the observations seems to be tidal disruption of a star by a central smbh , a scenario proposed by rees ( 1988 ) as a tracer of smbhs in nearby non - active galaxies . 
 the x - ray outburst in this hii galaxy then lends further support to the scenario that _ all _ galaxies passed through an active phase , leaving unfed smbhs in their centers ."
"evolutionary algorithms have been widely studied from a theoretical perspective . in particular , the area of runtime analysis 
 has contributed significantly to a theoretical understanding and provided insights into the working behaviour of these algorithms . 
 we study how these insights into evolutionary processes can be used for evolutionary art .

"quantum vacuum forces dictate the interaction between individual atoms and dielectric surfaces at nanoscale distances . 
 for example , their large strengths typically overwhelm externally applied forces , which makes it challenging to controllably interface cold atoms with nearby nanophotonic systems . here 
 , we show that it is possible to tailor the vacuum forces themselves to provide strong trapping potentials . 
 the trapping scheme takes advantage of the attractive ground state potential and adiabatic dressing with an excited state whose potential is engineered to be resonantly enhanced and repulsive . 
 this procedure yields a strong metastable trap , with the fraction of excited state population scaling inversely with the quality factor of the resonance of the dielectric structure . 
 we analyze realistic limitations to the trap lifetime and discuss possible applications that might emerge from the large trap depths and nanoscale confinement ."
"effective slam using a single monocular camera is highly preferred due to its simplicity . however , when compared to trajectory planning methods using depth - based slam , monocular slam in loop does need additional considerations . 
 one main reason being that for the optimization , in the form of bundle adjustment ( ba ) , to be robust , the slam system needs to scan the area for a reasonable duration . 
 most monocular slam systems do not tolerate large camera rotations between successive views and tend to breakdown . 
 other reasons for monocular slam failure include ambiguities in decomposition of the essential matrix , feature - sparse scenes and more layers of non linear optimization apart from ba . 
 this paper presents a novel formulation based on reinforcement learning ( rl ) that generates fail safe trajectories wherein the slam generated outputs ( scene structure and camera motion ) do not deviate largely from their true values . 
 quintessentially , the rl framework successfully learns the otherwise complex relation between motor actions and perceptual inputs that result in trajectories that do not cause failure of slam , which are almost intractable to capture in an obvious mathematical formulation . 
 we show systematically in simulations how the quality of the slam map and trajectory dramatically improves when trajectories are computed by using rl ."
"we present suzaku x - ray observations of the recurrent nova t crb in quiescence . 
 t crb is the first recurrent nova to be detected in the hard - x - ray band ( @xmath0 kev ) during quiescence . 
 the x - ray spectrum is consistent with cooling - flow emission emanating from an optically thin region in the boundary layer of an accretion disk around the white dwarf . 
 the detection of strong stochastic flux variations in the light curve supports the interpretation of the hard x - ray emission as emanating from a boundary layer ."
"evidence is emerging that the luminous x - ray sources in the cores of globular clusters may often consist of , or perhaps even as a class be dominated by , ultracompact ( p1  hr ) binary stars . 
 to the two such systems already known , in ngc6624 and ngc6712 , we now add evidence for two more . 
 we detect large amplitude variability in the candidate optical counterpart for the x - ray source in the core of ngc6652 . 
 although the available observations are relatively brief , the existing _ hubble space telescope _ data indicate a strong 43.6  min periodic modulation of the visible flux of semi - amplitude 30% . 
 further , although the orbital period of the source in ngc1851 is not yet explicitly measured , we demonstrate that previous correlations of optical luminosity with x - ray luminosity and accretion disk size , strengthened by recent data , strongly imply that the period of that system is also less than 1  hr . 
 thus currently there is evidence that 4 of the 7 globular cluster x - ray sources with constrained periods are ultracompact , a fraction far greater than that found in x - ray binaries the field .

"we analyze spatially resolved spectroscopic observations of the eta carinae binary system obtained with hst / stis . 
 eta car is enshrouded by the dusty homunculus nebula , which scatters light emitted by the central binary and provides a unique opportunity to study a massive binary system from different vantage points . 
 we investigate the latitudinal and azimuthal dependence of h@xmath0 line profiles caused by the presence of a wind - wind collision ( wwc ) cavity created by the companion star . using two - dimensional radiative transfer models , 
 we find that the wind cavity can qualitatively explain the observed line profiles around apastron . regions of the homunculus which scatter light that propagated through the wwc cavity show weaker or no h@xmath0 absorption . 
 regions scattering light that propagated through a significant portion of the primary wind show stronger p cygni absorption . 
 our models overestimate the h@xmath0 absorption formed in the primary wind , which we attribute to photoionization by the companion , not presently included in the models . 
 we can qualitatively explain the latitudinal changes that occur during periastron , shedding light on the nature of eta car s spectroscopic events . 
 our models support the idea that during the brief period of time around periastron when the primary wind flows unimpeded toward the observer , h@xmath0 absorption occurs in directions toward the central object and homunculus se pole , but not toward equatorial regions close to the weigelt blobs . 
 we suggest that observed latitudinal and azimuthal variations are dominated by the companion star via the wwc cavity , rather than by rapid rotation of the primary star ."
"in this paper we develop a quantum field approach to reveal the thermodynamic properties of the trapped bec with the equal rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit couplings . in the experimentally - feasible regime , the phase transition from the separate phase to the single minimum phase can be well driven by the tunable temperature . moreover , the critical temperature , which is independent of the trapped potential , can be derived exactly . at the critical point 
 , the specific heat has a large jump and can be thus regarded as a promising candidate to detect this temperature - driven phase transition . 
 in addition , we obtain the analytical expressions for the specific heat and the entropy in the different phases . in the single minimum phase , 
 the specific heat as well as the entropy are governed only by the rabi frequency . however , in the separate phase with lower temperature , we find that they are determined only by the strength of spin - orbit coupling . finally , the effect of the effective atom interaction is also addressed . in the separate phase , this effective atom interaction affects dramatically on the critical temperature and the corresponding thermodynamic properties ."

"the fairness of ieee 802.11 wireless networks ( including wireless lan and ad - hoc networks ) is hard to predict and control because of the randomness and complexity of the mac contentions and dynamics .

 we propose a novel distributed scheduling algorithm that we call vls , for `` _ variable - length scheduling _ '' , that provides weighted fairness to all stations despite the imperfections of the mac layer and physical channels . 
 distinct features of vls include the use of variable transmission lengths based on distributed observations , compatibility with 802.11 s contention window algorithm , opportunistic scheduling to achieve high throughput in time - varying wireless environments , and flexibility and ease of implementation .

 we also exhibit partial energy - weighted sums of the transition strength as functions of @xmath2 for all nuclei calculated , and transition densities for many of the interesting peaks .

 the low - lying @xmath3 strength near the neutron at large @xmath2 barely involves protons at all , with the strength coming primarily from a single two - quasineutron configuration with very large spatial extent . 
 the low - lying @xmath4 strength is different , with protons contributing to the transition density in the nuclear interior together with neutrons at large radii . 
 the low - lying @xmath1 transition strength goes largely to more localized states .

"the formation of secondary structures by a random rna sequence is studied as a model system for the sequence - structure problem omnipresent in biopolymers .

 we show that sequence disorder is perturbatively irrelevant , i.e. , an rna molecule with weak sequence disorder is in a _ molten phase _ where many secondary structures with comparable total energy coexist . 
 a numerical study of various models at high temperature reproduces behaviors characteristic of the molten phase . on the other hand , a scaling argument based on the extremal statistics of rare regions

 we find the excitation energy to grow very slowly ( i.e. , logarithmically ) with the length scale of the excitation , suggesting the existence of a marginal glass phase .

"first - generation ( population iii ) stars in the universe play an important role in early enrichment of heavy elements in galaxies and intergalactic medium and thus affect the history of galaxies . 
 the physical and chemical properties of primordial gas clouds are significantly different from those of present - day gas clouds observed in the nearby universe because the primordial gas clouds do not contain any heavy elements which are important coolants in the gas . 
 previous theoretical considerations have suggested that typical masses of the first - generation stars are between several @xmath0 and @xmath1 although it has been argued that the formation of very massive stars ( e.g. , @xmath2 ) is also likely . 
 if stars with several @xmath0 are most popular ones at the epoch of galaxy formation , most stars will evolve to hot ( e.g. , @xmath3 k ) , luminous ( @xmath4 ) stars with gaseous and dusty envelope prior to going to die as white dwarf stars . 
 although the duration of this phase is short ( e.g. , @xmath5 yr ) , such evolved stars could contribute both to the ionization of gas in galaxies and to the production of a lot of dust grains if the formation of intermediate - mass stars is highly enhanced . 
 we compare gaseous emission - line properties of such nebulae with some interesting high - redshift galaxies such as iras f10214 + 4724 and powerful radio galaxies ."
"we examine a regime in which a linearly - polarized laser pulse with relativistic intensity irradiates a sub - critical plasma for much longer than the characteristic electron response time . 
 a steady - state channel is formed in the plasma in this case with quasi - static transverse and longitudinal electric fields . 
 these relatively weak fields significantly alter the electron dynamics . 
 the longitudinal electric field reduces the longitudinal dephasing between the electron and the wave , leading to an enhancement of the electron energy gain from the pulse . the energy gain in this regime 
 is ultimately limited by the superluminosity of the wave fronts induced by the plasma in the channel . 
 the transverse electric field alters the oscillations of the transverse electron velocity , allowing it to remain anti - parallel to laser electric field and leading to a significant energy gain . 
 the energy enhancement is accompanied by development of significant oscillations perpendicular to the plane of the driven motion , making trajectories of energetic electrons three - dimensional . proper electron injection into the laser beam can further boost the electron energy gain ."

 we discuss quantum cryptographic protocols based on the transmission of weak coherent states and present a new system , based on a symbiosis of two existing ones , and for which the information available to the eavesdropper is significantly reduced .

"from the viewpoint of the formulation of the su(2 ) coherent states and their path integrals labeled by a full set of euler angles @xmath0 which we developed in the previous paper , we study the relations between gauge symmetries of lagrangians and allowed quantum states ; we investigate permissible types of fiducial vectors in the full quantum dynamics in terms of su(2 ) coherent states . 
 we propose a general framework for a lagrangian having a certain gauge symmetry with respect to one of the euler angles @xmath1 . 
 we find that when a lagrangian has the gauge symmetry fiducial vectors are so restricted that they belong to the eigenstates of @xmath2 or to the orbits of them under the action of the su(2 ) ; and the strength of a fictitious monopole , which appears in the lagrangian , is a multiple of @xmath3 . in this case dirac strings are permitted . 
 one exceptional case exists when the fictitious monopole charge disappears .

"we present theoretical studies of the influence of spin orbit coupling on the spin wave excitations of the fe monolayer and bilayer on the w(110 ) surface . 
 the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction is active in such films , by virtue of the absence of reflection symmetry in the plane of the film . 
 when the magnetization is in plane , this leads to a linear term in the spin wave dispersion relation for propagation across the magnetization . 
 the dispersion relation thus assumes a form similar to that of an energy band of an electron trapped on a semiconductor surfaces with rashba coupling active . 
 we also show speels response functions that illustrate the role of spin orbit coupling in such measurements . 
 in addition to the modifications of the dispersion relations for spin waves , the presence of spin orbit coupling in the w substrate leads to a substantial increase in the linewidth of the spin wave modes . 
 the formalism we have developed applies to a wide range of systems , and the particular system explored in the numerical calculations provides us with an illustration of phenomena which will be present in other ultrathin ferromagnet / substrate combinations ."
"we consider the x - ray luminosity difference between neutron star and black hole soft x - ray transients ( ns and bh sxts ) in quiescence . 
 the current observational data suggest that bh sxts are significantly fainter than ns sxts . 
 the luminosities of quiescent bh sxts are consistent with the predictions of binary evolution models for the mass transfer rate if ( 1 ) accretion occurs via an adaf in these systems and ( 2 ) the accreting compact objects have event horizons . 
 the luminosities of quiescent ns sxts are not consistent with the predictions of adaf models when combined with binary evolution models , unless most of the mass accreted in the adaf is prevented from reaching the neutron star surface . 
 we consider the possibility that mass accretion is reduced in quiescent ns sxts because of an efficient propeller and develop a model of the propeller effect that accounts for the observed luminosities . 
 we argue that modest winds from adafs are consistent with the observations , while strong winds are probably not .    #

"for random walks on networks ( graphs ) , it is a theoretical challenge to explicitly determine the mean first - passage time ( mfpt ) between two nodes averaged over all pairs . in this paper 
 , we study the mfpt of random walks in the famous t - graph , linking this important quantity to the resistance distance in electronic networks . 
 we obtain an exact formula for the mfpt that is confirmed by extensive numerical calculations . the interesting quantity is derived through the recurrence relations resulting from the self - similar structure of the t - graph . 
 the obtained closed - form expression exhibits that the mfpt approximately increases as a power - law function of the number of nodes , with the exponent lying between 1 and 2 . 
 our research may shed light on the deeper understanding of random walks on the t - graph ."
"the orbital structure of triaxial models with weak central density cusps , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , is investigated . 
 the stability of the @xmath2- ( long- ) axis orbit  and hence the existence of box orbits  depends sensitively on @xmath3 ; the range of model shapes for which the @xmath2-axis orbit is stable becomes progressively smaller as @xmath3 approaches one .

"cells are constantly exposed to fluctuating environmental conditions . 
 external signals are sensed , processed and integrated by cellular signal transduction networks , which translate input signals into specific cellular responses by means of biochemical reactions . 
 these networks have a complex nature , and we are still far from having a complete characterization of the process through which they integrate information , specially given the noisy environment in which that information is embedded . 
 guided by the many instances of constructive influences of noise that have been reported in the physical sciences in the last decades , here we explore how multiple signals are integrated in an eukaryotic cell in the presence of background noise , or chatter . to that end 
 , we use a boolean model of a typical human signal transduction network . despite its complexity 
 , we find that the network is able to display simple patterns of signal integration . 
 furthermore , our computational analysis shows that these integration patterns depend on the levels of fluctuating background activity carried by other cell inputs . taken together , 
 our results indicate that signal integration is sensitive to environmental fluctuations , and that this background noise effectively determines the information integration capabilities of the cell .

"charge equilibration has been recognized as a dominant process at the early stage of low - energy heavy - ion reactions . 
 the production of exotic nuclei is suppressed under the appearance of charge equilibration , in which the proton - neutron ratios of the final reaction products are inevitably averaged . 
 therefore charge equilibration plays one of the most crucial roles in the synthesis of chemical elements . 
 focusing on how and when the charge equilibration takes place , the zero - sound propagation in femto - scale quantum liquids is explained ."
"protostellar jets and winds are probably driven magnetocentrifugally from the surface of accretion disks close to the central stellar objects . 
 the exact launching conditions on the disk , such as the distributions of magnetic flux and mass ejection rate , are poorly unknown . 
 they could be constrained from observations at large distances , provided that a robust model is available to link the observable properties of the jets and winds at the large distances to the conditions at the base of the flow . 
 we discuss the difficulties in constructing such large - scale wind models , and describe a novel technique which enables us to numerically follow the acceleration and propagation of the wind from the disk surface to arbitrarily large distances and the collimation of part of the wind into a dense , narrow `` jet '' around the rotation axis . 
 special attention is paid to the shape of the jet and its mass flux relative to that of the whole wind . 
 the mass flux ratio is a measure of the jet formation efficiency ."
"using the gauge - gravity duality , we argue that for a certain class of out - of - equilibrium steady - state systems in contact with a thermal background at a given temperature , the macroscopic physics can be captured by an effective thermodynamic description . 
 the steady - state is obtained by applying a constant electric field that results in a stationary current flow . within holography 
 , we consider generic probe systems where an open string equivalence principle and an open string metric govern the effective thermodynamics . 
 this description comes equipped with an effective temperature , which is larger than the background temperature , and a corresponding effective entropy . for conformal or scale - invariant theories , certain scaling behaviours follow immediately . in general , in the large electric field limit , this effective temperature is also observed to obey generic relations with various physical parameters in the system ."
"we present a study of spatial variations in the metallicity of old red giant branch stars in the andromeda galaxy . 
 photometric metallicity estimates are derived by interpolating isochrones for over seven million stars in the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury ( phat ) survey . 
 this is the first systematic study of stellar metallicities over the inner 20  kpc of andromeda s galactic disk . 
 we see a clear metallicity gradient of @xmath0 dex / kpc from @xmath1 kpc assuming a constant rgb age . 
 this metallicity gradient is derived after correcting for the effects of photometric bias and completeness and dust extinction and is quite insensitive to these effects . 
 the unknown age gradient in m31 s disk creates the dominant systematic uncertainty in our derived metallicity gradient . 
 however , spectroscopic analyses of galaxies similar to m31 show that they typically have small age gradients that make this systematic error comparable to the 1@xmath2 error on our metallicity gradient measurement . in addition to the metallicity gradient , we observe an asymmetric local enhancement in metallicity at radii of 3 - 6  kpc that appears to be associated with andromeda s elongated bar . 
 this same region also appears to have an enhanced stellar density and velocity dispersion ."
"recent works on planetary migration show that the orbital structure of the kuiper belt can be very well reproduced if before the onset of the planetary instability neptune underwent a long - range planetesimal - driven migration up to @xmath028 au . however , considering that all giant planets should have been captured in mean motion resonances among themselves during the gas - disk phase , it is not clear whether such a very specific evolution for neptune is possible , nor whether the instability could have happened at late times . here , 
 we first investigate which initial resonant configuration of the giant planets can be compatible with neptune being extracted from the resonant chain and migrating to @xmath028 au before that the planetary instability happened . 
 we address the late instability issue by investigating the conditions where the planets can stay in resonance for about 400 my . our results indicate that this can happen only in the case where the planetesimal disk is beyond a specific minimum distance @xmath1 from neptune . then , if there is a sufficient amount of dust produced in the planetesimal disk , that drifts inwards , neptune can enter in a slow dust - driven migration phase for hundreds of mys until it reaches a critical distance @xmath2 from the disk . from that point , 
 faster planetesimal - driven migration takes over and neptune continues migrating outward until the instability happens . 
 we conclude that , although an early instability reproduces more easily the evolution of neptune required to explain the structure of the kuiper belt , such evolution is also compatible with a late instability ."
"folksonomies  large databases arising from collaborative tagging of items by independent users - are becoming an increasingly important way of categorizing information . in these systems 
 users can tag items with free words , resulting in a tripartite item - tag - user network . 
 although there are no prescribed relations between tags , the way users think about the different categories presumably has some built in hierarchy , in which more special concepts are descendants of some more general categories . 
 several applications would benefit from the knowledge of this hierarchy . here 
 we apply a recent method to check the differences and similarities of hierarchies resulting from tags given by independent individuals and from tags given by a centrally managed repository system . 
 the results from our method showed substantial differences between the lower part of the hierarchies , and in contrast , a relatively high similarity at the top of the hierarchies .

"we study the plasma - induced modifications of the potential and charge distribution across the interface of a plasma and a dielectric wall . for this purpose , the wall - bound surplus charge arising from the plasma 
 is modelled as a quasi - stationary electron surface layer in thermal equilibrium with the wall . 
 it satisfies poisson s equation and minimizes the grand canonical potential of wall - thermalized excess electrons . 
 based on an effective model for a graded interface taking into account the image potential and the offset of the conduction band to the potential just outside the dielectric , we specifically calculate the modification of the potential and the distribution of the surplus electrons for mgo , sio@xmath0 and al@xmath0o@xmath1 surfaces in contact with a helium discharge . depending on the electron affinity of the surface , we find two vastly different behaviors . for negative electron affinity , electrons do not penetrate into the wall and a quasi - two - dimensional electron gas is formed in the image potential , while for positive electron affinity , electrons penetrate into the wall and a negative space charge layer develops in the interior of the dielectric . 
 we also investigate how the non - neutral electron surface layer  which can be understood as the ultimate boundary of a bounded gas discharge  merges with the neutral bulk of the dielectric ."
"sequences of experimental ground - state energies for both odd and even @xmath0 are mapped onto concave patterns cured from convexities due to pairing and/or shell effects .

"in indirect resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) an intermediate state is created with a core - hole that has an ultrashort lifetime . 
 the core - hole potential therefore acts as a femtosecond pulse on the valence electrons . 
 we show that this fact can be exploited to integrate out the intermediate states from the expressions for the scattering cross section . by this 
 we obtain an effective scattering cross section that only contains the initial and final scattering states . 
 we derive in detail the effective cross section which turns out to be a resonant scattering factor times a linear combination of the charge response function @xmath0 and the dynamic longitudinal spin density correlation function . 
 this result is asymptotically exact for both strong and weak local core - hole potentials and ultrashort lifetimes . 
 the resonant scattering pre - factor is shown to be weakly temperature dependent . 
 we also derive a sum - rule for the total scattering intensity and generalize the results to multi - band systems . 
 one of the remarkable outcomes is that one can change the relative charge and spin contribution to the inelastic spectral weight by varying the incident photon energy ."

"we investigate the use of a logarithmic density variable in estimating the lagrangian displacement field , motivated by the success of a logarithmic transformation in restoring information to the matter power spectrum . 
 the logarithmic relation is an extension of the linear relation , motivated by the continuity equation , in which the density field is assumed to be proportional to the divergence of the displacement field ; we compare the linear and logarithmic relations by measuring both of these fields directly in a cosmological @xmath0-body simulation . 
 the relative success of the logarithmic and linear relations depends on the scale at which the density field is smoothed . 
 thus we explore several ways of measuring the density field , including cloud - in - cell smoothing , adaptive smoothing , and the ( scale - independent ) delaunay tessellation , and we use both a fourier space and a geometrical tessellation approach to measuring the divergence . 
 we find that the relation between the divergence of the displacement field and the density is significantly tighter with a logarithmic density variable , especially at low redshifts and for very small ( @xmath12 h@xmath2mpc ) smoothing scales . 
 we find that the grid - based methods are more reliable than the tessellation - based method of calculating both the density and the divergence fields , though in both cases the logarithmic relation works better in the appropriate regime , which corresponds to nonlinear scales for the grid - based methods and low densities for the tessellation - based method ."
"voting rules allow multiple agents to aggregate their preferences in order to reach joint decisions . 
 perhaps one of the most important desirable properties in this context is _ condorcet - consistency _ , which requires that a voting rule should return an alternative that is preferred to any other alternative by some majority of voters . 
 another desirable property is _ participation _ , which requires that no voter should be worse off by joining an electorate . 
 a seminal result in social choice theory by @xcite has shown that condorcet - consistency and participation are incompatible whenever there are at least  4 alternatives and  25 voters . 
 we leverage sat solving to obtain an elegant human - readable proof of moulin s result that requires only  12 voters . 
 moreover , the sat solver is able to construct a condorcet - consistent voting rule that satisfies participation as well as a number of other desirable properties for up to 11  voters , proving the optimality of the above bound . 
 we also obtain tight results for set - valued and probabilistic voting rules , which complement and significantly improve existing theorems ."

 we will show that characteristic behaviors of the josephson current for @xmath3 are clearly different from those for @xmath4 . 
 the topologically protected zero - energy surface bound states are responsible for the clear difference . 
 we conclude that the josephson current well reflects character of the topological surface states and the pairing symmetry of noncentrosymmetric superconductors ."

 this is the first clear example of a shock front in a cluster . from the jumps in the gas density and temperature at the shock , 
 the mach number of the bullet - like cloud is 23 . 
 this corresponds to a velocity of 30004000  relative to the main cluster , which means that the cloud traversed the core just 0.10.2 gyr ago . 
 the 67 kev `` bullet '' appears to be a remnant of a dense cooling flow region once located at the center of a merging subcluster whose outer gas has been stripped by ram pressure . 
 the bullet s shape indicates that it is near the final stage of being destroyed by ram pressure and gas dynamic instabilities , as the subcluster galaxies move well ahead of the cool gas . 
 the unique simplicity of the shock front and bullet geometry in emay allow a number of interesting future measurements . 
 the cluster s average temperature is @xmath0 kev but shows large spatial variations .

"recently , holz & wald have presented a new method for determining gravitational lensing effects on , e.g. , supernova luminosity versus redshift measurements in inhomogeneous universes . in this paper , 
 their method is generalized in several ways : first , the matter content is allowed to consist of several different types of fluids , possibly with non - vanishing pressure . 
 second , besides lensing by simple point masses and singular isothermal spheres , the more realistic halo dark matter distribution proposed by navarro , frenk & white ( nfw ) , based on n - body simulation results , is treated .

 we find in agreement with other recent work that a large sample of supernovae at large redshift could be used to extract gross features of the mass distribution of the lensing dark matter halos , such as the existence of a large number of point - like objects .

 we solve the zero - temperature ( @xmath1 ) bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations for the quasi-1d fermi gas with the dispersion modified by tunneling between the tubes , and show that the @xmath1 phase diagram hosts the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) phase with non - zero center of mass momentum cooper pairs for small values of the soc while for larger values of the soc and high zeeman fields the uniform superfluid phase with zero center of mass momentum cooper pairs has an instability towards the topological uniform superfluid phase with majorana fermions at the tube ends . 
 also , we show that tuning the two - dimensional optical lattice strength in this model allows one to explore the crossover behaviors of the phases during the transition between the 3d and the 1d system and in general the fflo ( for small soc ) and the topological uniform superfluid phase ( for large soc ) are favored as the system becomes more one - dimensional . 
 we also find evidence of the existence of a zeeman tuned topological quantum phase transition ( tqpt ) within the fflo phase itself and for large values of the zeeman field and small soc the tqpt gives rise to a topologically distinct fflo phase ."
"this work provides a comprehensive scaling law based performance analysis for multi - cell multi - user massive multiple - input - multiple - output ( mimo ) downlink systems with maximal - ratio transmission ( mrt ) . 
 imperfect channel state information ( csi ) , pilot contamination , and channel spatial correlation are all considered . 
 first , a sum - rate lower bound is derived by exploiting the asymptotically deterministic property of the received signal power , while keeping the random nature of other components in the signal - to - interference - plus - noise - ratio ( sinr ) intact . via a general scaling model on important network parameters , including the number of users , the channel training energy and the data transmission power , with respect to the number of base station antennas , the asymptotic scaling law of the effective sinr is obtained , which reveals quantitatively the tradeoff of the network parameters . 
 more importantly , pilot contamination and pilot contamination elimination ( pce ) are considered in the analytical framework . 
 in addition , the applicability of the derived asymptotic scaling law in practical systems with large but finite antenna numbers are discussed .

"protein aggregation is of great importance in biology , e.g. , in amyloid fibrillation . 
 the aggregation processes that occur at the cellular scale must be highly stochastic in nature because of the statistical number fluctuations that arise on account of the small system size at the cellular scale . 
 we study the nucleated reversible self - assembly of monomeric building blocks into polymer - like aggregates using the method of kinetic monte carlo . 
 kinetic monte carlo , being inherently stochastic , allows us to study the impact of fluctuations on the polymerisation reactions . 
 one of the most important characteristic features in this kind of problem is the existence of a lag phase before self - assembly takes off , which is what we focus attention on . 
 we study the associated lag time as a function of the system size and kinetic pathway . 
 we find that the leading order stochastic contribution to the lag time before polymerisation commences is inversely proportional to the system volume for large - enough system size for all nine reaction pathways tested .

"we study the one - shot zero - error classical capacity of a quantum channel assisted by quantum no - signalling correlations , and the reverse problem of exact simulation of a prescribed channel by a noiseless classical one . 
 quantum no - signalling correlations are viewed as two - input and two - output completely positive and trace preserving maps with linear constraints enforcing that the device can not signal . both problems lead to simple semidefinite programmes ( sdps ) that depend only on the kraus operator space of the channel . in particular 
 , we show that the zero - error classical simulation cost is precisely the conditional min - entropy of the choi - jamiokowski matrix of the given channel . 
 the zero - error classical capacity is given by a similar - looking but different sdp ; the asymptotic zero - error classical capacity is the regularization of this sdp , and in general we do not know of any simple form . 
 interestingly however , for the class of classical - quantum channels , we show that the asymptotic capacity is given by a much simpler sdp , which coincides with a semidefinite generalization of the fractional packing number suggested earlier by aram harrow .

"interaction of domain walls ( dws ) in ferromagnetic stripes is studied with relevance to the formation of stable complexes of many domains . 
 two dw system is described with the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation including regimes of narrow and wide stripes which correspond the presence of transverse and vortex dws . 
 the dws of both kinds are characterized with their chiralities ( the direction of the magnetization rotation in the stripe plane ) and polarities ( the magnetization orientation in the center of a vortex and/or halfvortices ) , hence , their interactions are analyzed with dependence on these properties . 
 in particular , pairs of the dws of opposite or like chiralities and polarities are investigated as well as pairs of opposite ( like ) chiralities and of like ( opposite ) polarities .

"in this paper , we present surface brightness profiles for 79 globular clusters in m31 , using images observed with _ hubble space telescope _ , some of which are from new observations . 
 the structural and dynamical parameters are derived from fitting the profiles to several different models for the first time . 
 the results show that in the majority of cases , king models fit the m31 clusters as well as wilson models , and better than srsic models . however , there are 11 clusters best fitted by srsic models with the srsic index @xmath0 , meaning that they have cuspy central density profiles 
 . these clusters may be the well - known core - collapsed candidates . 
 there is a bimodality in the size distribution of m31 clusters at large radii , which is different from their galactic counterparts . in general , the properties of clusters in m31 and the milky way fall in the same regions of parameter spaces .

 logistic regression is the optimization of the expected value of the logarithmic scoring rule .

 our theoretical analysis shows how different members of this family induce different relative weightings over a spectrum of applications of which the decision thresholds range from low to high . 
 special attention is given to the interaction between prior weighting and proper scoring rule parameters .

"while the connection between long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and type ib / c supernovae ( sne

"we compare the time evolution of entanglement measures after local operator excitation in the critical ising model with predictions from conformal field theory . for the spin operator and its descendants 
 we find that rnyi entropies of a block of spins increase by a constant that matches the logarithm of the quantum dimension of the conformal family . 
 however , for the energy operator we find a small constant contribution that differs from the conformal field theory answer equal to zero . 
 we argue that the mismatch is caused by the subtleties in the identification between the local operators in conformal field theory and their lattice counterpart . 
 our results indicate that evolution of entanglement measures in locally excited states not only constraints this identification , but also can be used to extract non - trivial data about the conformal field theory that governs the critical point . 
 we generalize our analysis to the ising model away from the critical point , states with multiple local excitations , as well as the evolution of the relative entropy after local operator excitation and discuss universal features that emerge from numerics .

"there are only a few tracers available to probe the kinematics of individual early - type galaxies beyond one effective radius . here 
 we directly compare a sample of planetary nebulae ( pne ) , globular clusters ( gcs ) and galaxy starlight velocities out to @xmath04 effective radii , in the s0 galaxy ngc 2768 . 
 using a bulge - to - disk decomposition of a k - band image we assign pne and starlight to either the disk or the bulge . 
 we show that the bulge pne and bulge starlight follow the same radial density distribution as the red subpopulation of gcs , whereas the disk pne and disk starlight are distinct components . 
 we find good kinematic agreement between the three tracers to several effective radii ( and with stellar data in the inner regions ) . 
 further support for the distinct nature of the two galaxy components come from our kinematic analysis . 
 after separating the tracers into bulge and disk components we find the bulge to be a slowly rotating pressure - supported system , whereas the disk reveals a rapidly rising rotation curve with a declining velocity dispersion profile . 
 the resulting v@xmath1/@xmath2 ratio for the disk resembles that of a spiral galaxy and hints at an origin for ngc 2768 as a transformed late - type galaxy . a two - component kinematic analysis for

"we study here the curious particle dynamics resulting from electro - osmotic flow around a microchannel junction corner whose dielectric walls are weakly polarizable . 
 the hydrodynamic velocity field is obtained via superposition of a linear irrotational term associated with the equilibrium zeta potentials of both the microchannel and particle surfaces and the non - linear induced - charge electro - osmotic flow which originates from the interaction of the externally applied electric field on the charge cloud it induces at the solid - liquid interface . 
 the particle dynamics are analyzed by considering dielectrophoretic forces via the addition of a mobility term to the flow field in the limit of stokes drag law . 
 the former , non - divergence free term is responsible for migration of particles towards the sharp microchannel junction corner , where they can potentially accumulate . 
 experimental observations of particle trapping for various applied electric fields and microparticle size are rationalized in terms of the growing relative importance of the dielectrophoretic force and induced - charge contributions to the global velocity field with increasing intensity of the externally applied electric field ."
"an interesting feature of the giant planets of our solar system is the existence of regions around these objects where no irregular satellites are observed . 
 surveys have shown that , around jupiter , such a region extends from the outermost regular satellite callisto , to the vicinity of themisto , the innermost irregular satellite . to understand the reason for the existence of such a _ satellite - void _ region , we have studied the dynamical evolution of jovian irregulars by numerically integrating the orbits of several hundred test particles , distributed in a region between 30 and 80 jupiter - radii , for different values of their semimajor axes , orbital eccentricities , and inclinations . as expected , our simulations indicate that objects in or close to the influence zones of the galilean satellites become unstable because of interactions with ganymede and callisto . 
 however , these perturbations can not account for the lack of irregular satellites in the entire region between callisto and themisto . 
 it is suggested that at distances between 60 and 80 jupiter - radii , ganymede and callisto may have long - term perturbative effects , which may require the integrations to be extended to times much longer than 10 myr . 
 the interactions of irregular satellites with protosatellites of jupiter at the time of the formation of jovian regulars may also be a destabilizing mechanism in this region .

 the lattice vibration modes associated with the self - trapped polarons are analyzed in detail , and the frequency softening of the vibration mode at the central site of the small polaron is estimated . 
 it is shown that the first excited state of the system in the strong coupling regime corresponds to the excitation of the soft phonon mode within the polaron . in the crossover regime , the ground and the first excited state of the system can be approximated by the anticrossing of the self - trapped and the delocalized polaron state . in this way , the connection between the behavior of the ground and the first excited state is qualitatively explained ."

 our results imply that this phenomenon is already present in a trapped @xmath0-wave superfluid fermi gas with spin imbalance . as an interesting application of this phenomenon , we point out that one may produce a @xmath1-wave superfluid fermi gas , by suddenly changing the @xmath0-wave pairing interaction to a @xmath1-wave one by using the feshbach resonance technique . 
 since a cooper pair is usually classified into the spin - singlet ( and even - parity ) state and the spin - triplet ( and odd - parity ) state , our results would be useful in considering how to mix them with each other in a superfluid fermi gas . 
 such admixture has recently attracted much attention in the field of non - centrosymmetric superconductivity , so that our results would also contribute to the further development of this research field , on the viewpoint of cold fermi gas physics ."
"the structural profiles and electronic properties of pentacene ( c@xmath0h@xmath1 ) multilayers on ag(111 ) surface has been studied within the density functional theory ( dft ) framework . 
 we have performed first - principle total energy calculations based on the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method to investigate the initial growth patterns of pentacene ( pn ) on ag(111 ) surface . in its bulk phase , pentacene crystallizes with a triclinic symmetry while a thin film phase having an orthorhombic unit cell is energetically less favorable by 0.12 ev / cell . 
 pentacene prefers to stay planar on ag(111 ) surface and aligns perfectly along silver rows without any molecular deformation at a height of 3.9  . at one monolayer ( ml ) 
 coverage the separation between the molecular layer and the surface plane extends to 4.1  due to intermolecular interactions weakening surface 
 pentacene attraction . 
 while the first ml remains flat , the molecules on a second full pentacene layer deposited on the surface rearrange so that they become skewed with respect to each other . 
 this adsorption mode is energetically more preferable than the one for which the molecules form a flat pentacene layer by an energy difference similar to that obtained for bulk and thin film phases . 
 moreover , as new layers added , pentacenes assemble to maintain this tilting for 3 and 4 ml similar to its bulk phase while the contact layer always remains planar . 
 therefore , our calculations indicate bulk - like initial stages for the growth pattern ."
"a simple numerical model is used to simulate the effect of vertical taps on a packing of monodisperse hard spheres . 
 our results are in good agreement with an experimental work done in chicago and with other previous models , especially concerning the dynamics of the compaction , the influence of the excitation strength on the compaction efficiency , and some ageing effects . 
 the principal asset of the model is that it allows a local analysis of the packings . 
 vertical and transverse density profiles are used as well as size and volume distributions of the pores . 
 an interesting result concerns the appearance of a vertical gradient in the density profiles during compaction . 
 furthermore , the volume distribution of the pores suggests that the smallest pores , ranging in size between a tetrahedral and an octahedral site , are not strongly affected by the tapping process , in contrast to the largest pores which are more sensitive to the compaction of the packing .    2"
"we observed b1600 + 434  and b1608 + 656  with cxo / acis , detecting both quasar images in b1600 + 434  and three of four images in b1608 + 656 . 
 we did not detect significant x - ray emission from nearby galaxy groups or clusters associated with each lens galaxy . 
 the upper limits on the x - ray luminosity of any cluster within 4  of each lens and at each lens redshift are of @xmath0 and @xmath1  for b1600 + 434  and b1608 + 656 , respectively . 
 the radio - loud source quasars have power - law photon indices of @xmath2 and @xmath3 and x - ray luminosities of @xmath410@xmath5 and @xmath6  for b1600 + 434  and b1608 + 656 , respectively before correcting for the magnification . 
 we detected a differential absorption column density of @xmath7 between the two images of b1600 + 434 , roughly consistent with expectations from differential extinction estimates of @xmath8  mag and a standard dust - to - gas ratio . 
 the differential absorption observed in gravitational lenses may serve as an important probe to study the gas content in high redshift galaxies since it can separate the absorbing column originating from the lens galaxy and those intrinsic to quasars .

"the main aim of this paper is to establish the connection between well - known criteria for the pseudocontinuability of a non - inner schur function @xmath0 in the unit disk ( see theorems  [ t3.9 ] and [ t4.2 ] ) . in a canonical way we associate a probability measure @xmath1 on the unit circle with @xmath0 .

 these results were derived for the lieb - mattis spin model . here 
 we will show that the underlying mechanism of decoherence in systems with spontaneous symmetry breaking is in fact more general . 
 we present here a generic route to finding the decoherence time associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking in many particle qubits , and subsequently we apply this approach to two model systems , indicating how the continuous symmetries in these models are spontaneously broken and discussing the relation of this symmetry breaking to the thin spectrum . 
 we then present in detail the calculations that lead to the limit to quantum coherence , which is due to energy shifts in the thin spectrum ."

 the use of uniform 3d real - space grids for representing wave functions , densities and potentials allows for flexible boundary conditions , efficient multigrid algorithms for solving poisson and kohn - sham equations , and efficient parallelization using simple real - space domain - decomposition . 
 we use the paw method to perform all - electron calculations in the frozen core approximation , with smooth valence wave functions that can be represented on relatively coarse grids . 
 we demonstrate the accuracy of the method by calculating the atomization energies of twenty small molecules , and the bulk modulus and lattice constants of bulk aluminum .

"shallow cores in bright , massive galaxies are commonly thought to be the result of scouring of stars by mergers of binary supermassive black holes . 
 past investigations have suggested correlations between the central black hole mass and the stellar light or mass deficit in the core , using proxy measurements of @xmath0  or stellar mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath1 ) . 
 drawing on a wealth of dynamical models which provide both @xmath0  and @xmath1 , we identify cores in 23 galaxies , of which 20 have direct , reliable measurements of @xmath0  and dynamical stellar mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath2 ) . 
 these cores are identified and measured using core - srsic model fits to surface brightness profiles which extend out to large radii ( typically more than the effective radius of the galaxy ) ; for approximately one fourth of the galaxies , the best fit includes an outer ( srsic ) envelope component . 
 we find that the core radius is most strongly correlated with the black hole mass and that it correlates better with total galaxy luminosity than it does with velocity dispersion . 
 the strong core - size@xmath0  correlation enables estimation of black hole masses ( in core galaxies ) with an accuracy comparable to the @xmath0@xmath3 relation ( rms scatter of 0.30 dex in @xmath4 ) , without the need for spectroscopy . 
 the light and mass deficits correlate more strongly with galaxy velocity dispersion than they do with black hole mass . 
 stellar mass deficits span a range of 0.239 @xmath0 , with almost all ( 87% ) being @xmath5 ; the median value is 2.2 @xmath0 ."

"the detection of an afterglow , following a @xmath0-ray burst ( grb ) , can be described reasonably well by synchrotron emission from a relativistic spherical expanding blast wave , driven by an expanding fireball . 
 we perform detailed calculations considering the emission from the whole region behind the shock front . 
 we use the blandford mckee self similar adiabatic solution to describe the fluid behind the shock . using this detailed model , 
 we derive expressions for the peak flux , and the peak frequency at a given observed time . 
 these expressions provide important numerical corrections to previous , more simplified models . 
 we calculate the observed light curve and spectra for several magnetic field models . 
 we show that both the light curve and the spectra are flat near the peak . 
 this rules out the interpretation of the optical peak of grb970508 as the peak of the light curve , predicted by the existing fireball models . 
 we calculate the observed image of a grb afterglow . 
 the observed image is bright near the edge and dimmer at the center , thus creating a ring .

"we calculate the neutrino mean free path in color superconducting quark matter , and employ it to study the cooling of matter via neutrino diffusion in the superconducting phase as compared to a free quark phase . 
 the cooling process slows when quark matter undergoes a second order phase transition to a superconducting phase at the critical temperature @xmath0 . 
 cooling subsequently accelerates as the temperature decreases below @xmath0 . 
 this will directly impact the early evolution of a newly born neutron star , should its core contain quark matter . 
 consequently , there may be observable changes in the early neutrino emission which would provide evidence for superconductivity in hot and dense matter ."
"we present a kinetic theory for the evolution of the phase - space distribution of dark matter particles in galaxy halos in the presence of a cosmological spectrum of fluctuations . 
 this theory introduces a new way to model the formation and evolution of halos , which traditionally have been investigated by analytic gravitational infall models or numerical n - body methods . unlike the collisionless boltzmann equation , 
 our kinetic equation contains nonzero terms on the right - hand side arising from stochastic fluctuations in the gravitational potential due to substructures in the dark matter mass distribution . using statistics for constrained gaussian random fields in standard cosmological models , 
 we show that our kinetic equation to second - order in perturbation theory is of the fokker - planck form , with one scattering term representing drift and the other representing diffusion in velocity - space . 
 the drift is radial , and the drift and diffusion coefficients depend only on positions and not velocities ; our relaxation process in the quasilinear regime is therefore different from the standard two - body relaxation . 
 we provide explicit expressions relating these coefficients to the linear power spectrum of mass fluctuations and present results for the currently favored cold dark matter model with a nonzero cosmological constant . 
 solutions to this kinetic equation will provide a complete description of the cold dark matter spatial and velocity distributions for the average halo during the early phases of galaxy halo formation ."

"the structure of the concentration field of a decaying substance produced by chemical sources and advected by a smooth incompressible two - dimensional flow is investigated . 
 we focus our attention on the non - uniformities of the hlder exponent of the resulting filamental chemical field . 
 they appear most evidently in the case of open flows where irregularities of the field exhibit strong spatial intermittency as they are restricted to a fractal manifold . 
 non - uniformities of the hlder exponent of the chemical field in closed flows appears as a consequence of the non - uniform stretching of the fluid elements .

"in stochastic optimization , the population risk is generally approximated by the empirical risk . however , in the large - scale setting , minimization of the empirical risk may be computationally restrictive . in this paper , we design an efficient algorithm to approximate the population risk minimizer in generalized linear problems such as binary classification with surrogate losses and generalized linear regression models . 
 we focus on large - scale problems , where the iterative minimization of the empirical risk is computationally intractable , i.e. , the number of observations @xmath0 is much larger than the dimension of the parameter @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath2 . we show that under random sub - gaussian design , the true minimizer of the population risk is approximately proportional to the corresponding ordinary least squares ( ols ) estimator . using this relation

"we study the statics and dynamics of a stable , mobile , three - dimensional matter - wave spherical quantum ball created in the presence of an attractive two - body and a _ very small _ repulsive three - body interaction . 
 the quantum ball can propagate with a constant velocity in any direction in free space and its stability under a small perturbation is established numerically and variationally . in frontal head - on and angular collisions at large velocities two quantum balls behave like quantum solitons . 
 such collision is found to be quasi elastic and the quantum balls emerge after collision without any change of direction of motion and velocity and with practically no deformation in shape . when reflected by a hard impenetrable plane , the quantum ball bounces off like a wave obeying the law of reflection without any change of shape or speed . 
 however , in a collision at small velocities two quantum balls coalesce to form a larger ball which we call a quantum - ball breather .

"we study bond - order parameters for generalized @xmath0-@xmath1 models on a square lattice . using the plane - wave limit the considered order parameters form basis functions for irreducible representations of the symmetry transformations of the point group and of time reversal .

 for instability wave vectors along the crystalline axes , corresponding to the observed case in underdoped cuprates , there are only three representations with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 symmetry which do not break time reversal symmetry in the general case .

 no analogic shaping occurs the majority of the scintillation components are digitized , thus avoiding major information losses . 
 the obtained results suggest the existence of a correlation between the time constant of the scintillation emission and light yield ."

 mobile discrete breathers are seen to be a superposition of a localized mobile core and an extended background of two - dimensional nonlinear plane waves . 
 this structure is in agreement with previous results on one - dimensional breather mobility . 
 the study of the stability of both pinned and mobile solutions is performed using standard floquet analysis .

 effects on the transport and anisotropic magnetic properties of the single crystals are also presented . 
 increasing anisotropy of the atomic displacement parameters for bi with increasing temperature above @xmath0 is revealed by neutron diffraction measurements . 
 it is likely that this is directly related to the anisotropic thermal expansion in mnbi , which plays a key role in the spin reorientation and magnetocrystalline anisotropy .

"establishing bounds on the accuracy achievable by localization techniques represents a fundamental technical issue . 
 bounds on localization accuracy have been derived for cases in which the position of an agent is estimated on the basis of a set of observations and , possibly , of some a priori information related to them ( e.g. , information about anchor positions and properties of the communication channel ) . in this manuscript 
 new bounds are derived under the assumption that the localization system is _ map - aware _ , i.e. , it can benefit not only from the availability of observations , but also from the a priori knowledge provided by the _ map _ of the environment where it operates . 
 our results show that : a ) map - aware estimation accuracy can be related to some features of the map ( e.g. , its shape and area ) even though , in general , the relation is complicated ; b ) maps are really useful in the presence of some combination of low signal - to - noise ratios and specific geometrical features of the map ( e.g. , the size of obstructions ) ; c ) in most cases , there is no need of refined maps since additional details do not improve estimation accuracy .

"we propose a dynamical generalized polynomial chaos ( dgpc ) method to solve time - dependent stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) with white noise forcing . 
 the long - time simulation of spde solutions by polynomial chaos ( pc ) methods is notoriously difficult as the dimension of the stochastic variables increases linearly with time . exploiting the markovian property of white noise , 
 dgpc @xcite implements a restart procedure that allows us to expand solutions at future times in terms of orthogonal polynomials of the measure describing the solution at a given time and the future white noise . 
 the dimension of the representation is kept minimal by application of a karhunen  loeve ( kl ) expansion . using frequent restarts and low degree polynomials on sparse multi - index sets , 
 the method allows us to perform long time simulations , including the calculation of invariant measures for systems which possess one . 
 we apply the method to the numerical simulation of stochastic burgers and navier stokes equations with white noise forcing .

"we present predictions for two statistical measures of the hydrogen reionization process at high redshift .

 the second is the cross - correlation of neutral regions with possible sources of ionizing radiation . 
 these independent probes are sensitive to the topology of the ionized regions . 
 if reionization proceeded from high to low density regions then the cross - correlation will be negative , while if voids were ionized first then we expect a positive correlation and a relatively small number of long neutral segments .

 using optical nuclear luminosity , this relationship explains 95.9% of the variance in the overall sample , while 94.9% of the variance is accounted for if we use x - ray nuclear luminosity . 
 the form of this qso fundamental plane shows similarities to the well - studied fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies , and we examine the possible relationship between them as well as the difficulties involved in establishing this connection . 
 the key to the relationship might lie in the fueling mechanism of the central black hole .

"we investigate two coupled nonlinear cavities that are coherently driven in a dissipative environment . 
 we perform semiclassical , numerical and analytical quantum studies of this dimer model when both cavities are symmetrically driven . in the semiclassical analysis , we find steady - state solutions with different photon occupations in two cavities . 
 such states can be considered analogs of the closed system double well symmetry breaking states . 
 we analyze the occurrence and properties of these localized states in the system parameter space and examine how the symmetry breaking states , in form of a bistable pair , are associated to the single cavity bistable behavior . in a full quantum calculation of the master equation dynamics that includes quantum fluctuations , the symmetry breaking states and bistability disappear due to the quantum fluctuations . in quantum trajectory picture 
 , we observe enhanced quantum jumps and switching which indicate the presence of the underlying semiclassical symmetry breaking states . 
 finally , we present a set of analytical solutions for the steady state correlation functions using the complex p - representation and discuss its regime of validity ."
"we study the transverse momentum dependence of the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect in qed , starting from the high energy expansion of the solution of the dirac equation in the presence of an external field . 
 the angular integrated energy loss formula differs from an earlier expression of zakharov by taking finite kinematical boundaries into account . in an expansion in powers of the opacity of the medium 
 , we derive explicit expressions for the radiation cross section associated with @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 scatterings . 
 we verify the bethe - heitler and the factorization limit , and we calculate corrections to the factorization limit proportional to the square of the target size . 
 a closed form expression valid to arbitrary orders in the opacity is derived in the dipole approximation . 
 the resulting radiation spectrum is non - analytic in the coupling constant which is traced back to the transverse momentum broadening of a hard parton undergoing multiple small angle molire scattering . in extending the results to qcd , we test a previously used dipole prescription by comparing to direct pqcd results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . for @xmath0 , 
 the qcd dipole prescription reproduces exactly the bertsch - gunion radiation spectrum . for @xmath3 
 , we find a sizeable correction which reduces to a multiplicative factor 17/8 at large separation ."
"the permeability of two - dimensional fractures with self - affine fractal roughness is studied via analytic arguments and numerical simulations . 
 the limit where the roughness amplitude is small compared with average fracture aperture is analyzed by a perturbation method , while in the opposite case of narrow aperture , we use heuristic arguments based on lubrication theory . 
 numerical simulations , using the lattice boltzmann method , are used to examine the complete range of aperture sizes , and confirm the analytic arguments ."
"observations of the cosmic microwave background have revealed a component of 1060  ghz emission from the galaxy which correlates with 100140@xmath0 m emission from interstellar dust but has an intensity much greater than expected for the low - frequency tail of the `` electric dipole vibrational '' emission peaking at @xmath1130@xmath0 m . 
 this `` anomalous emission '' is more than can be accounted for by dust - correlated free - free emission . 
 the anomalous emission could be due in part to magnetic dipole emission from thermal fluctuations of the magnetization within interstellar dust grains , but only if a substantial fraction of the fe in interstellar dust resides in magnetic materials such as metallic iron or magnetite . 
 the observed anomalous emission is probably due primarily to electric dipole radiation from spinning ultrasmall interstellar dust grains . 
 this rotational emission is expected to be partially polarized ."
"the quarkonium hadroproduction in association with a photon at high energies provides a probe of the dynamics of the strong interactions as it is dependent on the nuclear gluon distribution . 
 therefore , it could be used to constrain the behavior of the nuclear gluon distribution in proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions . 
 such processes are useful to single out the magnitude of the shadowing / antishadowing effects in the nuclear parton densities . in this work 
 we investigate the influence of nuclear effects in the production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 and estimate the transverse momentum dependence of the nuclear modification factors . the theoretical framework considered in the @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) 
 production associated with a direct photon at the hadron collider is the non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) factorization formalism ."
"the charge transported when a quantum pump is adiabatically driven by time - dependent external forces in presence of dissipation is given by the line integral of a pumping field @xmath0 . 
 we give a general expression of @xmath0 in terms of quantum correlation functions evaluated at fixed external forces . 
 hence , an advantage of our method is that it transforms the original time - dependent problem into an autonomous one . 
 yet another advantage is that the curl of @xmath0 gives immediate visual information about the geometric structures governing dissipative quantum pumping . 
 this can be used in a wide range of experimental cases , including electron pumps based on quantum dots and cooper - pair pumps based on superconducting devices . 
 applied to a cooper - pair sluice , we find an intriguing dissipation - induced enhancement of charge pumping , reversals of current , and emergence of asymmetries . 
 this geometric method thus enables one to unveil a plethora of beneficial , dissipation - assisted operation protocols ."
"the dissociation spectrum of the hydrogen molecular ion by short intense pulses of infrared light is calculated . 
 the time - dependent schrdinger equation is discretized and integrated in position and momentum space . for few - cycle pulses one can resolve vibrational structure that commonly arises in the experimental preparation of the molecular ion from the neutral molecule . 
 we calculate the corresponding energy spectrum and analyze the dependence on the pulse time - delay , pulse length , and intensity of the laser for @xmath0 nm . we conclude that the proton spectrum is a both a sensitive probe of the vibrational dynamics and the laser pulse . finally we compare our results with recent measurements of the proton spectrum for 55 fs pulses using a ti : sapphire laser ( @xmath1 nm ) . integrating over the laser focal volume , for the intensity @xmath2w @xmath3 , we find our results are in excellent agreement with these experiments .    _ to be submitted to j. phys .

"point defects such as interstitials , vacancies , and impurities in otherwise perfect crystals induce complex displacement fields that are of long - range nature . in the present paper 
 we study numerically the response of a two - dimensional colloidal crystal on a triangular lattice to the introduction of an interstitial particle . 
 while far from the defect position the resulting displacement field is accurately described by linear elasticity theory , lattice effects dominate in the vicinity of the defect . in comparing the results of particle based simulations with continuum theory , 
 it is crucial to employ corresponding boundary conditions in both cases . for the periodic boundary condition used here 
 , the equations of elasticity theory can be solved in a consistent way with the technique of ewald summation familiar from the electrostatics of periodically replicated systems of charges and dipoles . 
 very good agreement of the displacement fields calculated in this way with those determined in particle simulations is observed for distances of more than about 10 lattice constants . 
 closer to the interstitial , strongly anisotropic displacement fields with exponential behavior can occur for certain defect configurations . here 
 we rationalize this behavior with a simple bead - spring that relates the exponential decay constant to the elastic constants of the crystal ."
"a problem of finding stationary states of open quantum systems is addressed .

"we theoretically investigate the supercurrent - induced magnetization dynamics of a two - dimensional lattice of ferromagnetically ordered spins placed on a conventional superconductor with broken spatial inversion symmetry and strong spin - orbit coupling . 
 we develop a phenomenological description of the coupled dynamics of the superconducting condensate and the spin system , and demonstrate that supercurrents produce a reactive spin - orbit torque on the magnetization . by performing a microscopic self - consistent calculation , we show that the spin - orbit torque originates from a spin - polarization of the cooper pairs due to current - induced spin - triplet correlations . 
 interestingly , we find that there exists an intrinsic limitation for the maximum achievable spin - orbit torque , which is determined by the coupling strength between the condensate and the spin system . in proximitized hole - doped semiconductors , 
 the maximum achievable spin - orbit torque field is estimated to be on the order of @xmath0 mt , which is comparable to the critical field for current - induced magnetization switching in ferromagnetic semiconductors ."
"in the synchrotron radiation model , the polarization property depends on both the configuration of the magnetic field and the geometry of the visible emitting region . some peculiar behaviors in the x - ray afterglows of _ swift _ gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , such as energetic flares and the plateau followed by a sharp drop , might by highly linearly - polarized because the outflows powering these behaviors may be poynting - flux dominated . furthermore , the broken - down of the symmetry of the visible emitting region may be hiding in current x - ray data and will give rise to interesting polarization signatures . in this work 
 we focus on the polarization accompanying the very early sharp decline of grb x - ray afterglows . 
 we show that strong polarization evolution is possible in both the high latitude emission model and the dying central engine model which are used to interpret this sharp x - ray decline . 
 it is thus not easy to efficiently probe the physical origin of the very early x - ray sharp decline with future polarimetry . 
 strong polarization evolution is also possible in the decline phase of x - ray flares and in the shallow decline phase of x - ray light curves characterized by chromatic x - ray vs. optical breaks .

"we examine the early angular momentum history of stars in young clusters via 197 photometric periods in the orion flanking fields , 83 photometric periods in ngc 2264 , and 256 measurements of @xmath0 in the onc . 
 we show that pms stars , even those without observable disks , apparently do not conserve stellar angular momentum as they evolve down their convective tracks , but instead evolve at nearly constant angular velocity . 
 this result is inconsistent with expectations that convective stars lacking disks should spin up as they contract , but paradoxically consistent with disk - locking models . 
 we briefly explore possible resolutions , including disk locking , birthline effects , stellar winds , and planetary companions . 
 we have found no plausible explanations for this paradox ."
"critical software systems face stringent requirements in safety , security , and reliability due to the circumstances surrounding their operation . 
 safety and security have progressively gained importance over the years due to the integration of hardware with software - intensive deployments that introduce additional sources of errors . 
 it is , then , necessary to follow high - quality exhaustive software development processes that besides the needed development activities to increase safety and security also integrate techniques to increase the reliability of the software development process itself . in practice , 
 the use of automated techniques for the _ verification of the verification process _ is , however , not sufficiently wide spread . 
 this is mainly due to the high cost of the required techniques and to their degree of complexity when adjusting to the different norms and regulations . 
 this work presents an approach for comprehensive management of the verification processes ; the approach allows engineers to monitor and control the project status regarding the applicable standards . 
 this approach has been validated through its implementation in a tool and its application to real projects ."
"the d / h ratio of water in protostellar systems is a result of both inheritance from the parent molecular cloud and isotopic exchange in the disc . 
 a possibly widespread feature of disc evolution , ignored in previous studies , is accretion bursts ( or fu orionis outbursts ) , which may thermally process a large fraction of the water . 
 one proposed underlying mechanism for fu orionis outbursts relies on the presence of a magnetically dead zone . here 
 we examine the evolution of ( d / h)@xmath0 in 1d simulations of a disc s evolution that include dead zones and infall from an envelope with given d / h ratio in the infalling water ( @xmath1 ) , and compare the results with similar calculations without dead zones . 
 we find that the accretion bursts result in a significantly lower ( d / h)@xmath0 ratio and a more extended region ( radius up to @xmath2 au ) where water is equilibrated with hydrogen gas ( d / h=@xmath3 ) , when compared to burst - free models . 
 solar system constraints suggest that our solar nebula either experienced no accretion bursts and had a schmidt number @xmath4 or had a schmidt number closer to `` nominal '' values ( @xmath5 ) and experienced several accretion bursts . 
 finally , future observations of ( d / h)@xmath0 in protoplanetary discs will allow inferences about angular momentum properties of the disc during disc building and the role of accretion bursts .

"the experimental observation of quantum phenomena in strongly correlated many particle systems is difficult because of the short length- and timescales involved . 
 obtaining at the same time detailed control of individual constituents appears even more challenging and thus to date inhibits employing such systems as quantum computing devices . 
 substantial progress to overcome these problems has been achieved with cold atoms in optical lattices , where a detailed control of collective properties is feasible but it is very difficult to address and hence control or measure individual sites . here we show , that polaritons , combined atom and photon excitations , in an array of cavities such as a photonic crystal or coupled toroidal micro - cavities , can form a strongly interacting many body system , where individual particles can be controlled and measured . 
 all individual building blocks of the proposed setting have already been experimentally realised , thus demonstrating the potential of this device as a quantum simulator . with the possibility to create attractive on - site potentials 
 the scheme allows for the creation of highly entangled states and a phase with particles much more delocalised than in superfluids ."
"a rigorous quantum relativistic approach has been used to calculate the relationship between the decay laws of an unstable particle seen from two inertial frames moving with respect to each other . in agreement with experiment , it is found that the usual einstein s time dilation formula is rather accurate in this case .

 although the observation of these corrections is beyond the resolution of modern experiments , their presence indicates that special relativistic time dilation is not rigorously applicable to particle decays ."

"this paper presents a mechanism for the coexistence of hyperbolic and non - hyperbolic dynamics arising in a neighbourhood of a conservative bykov cycle where trajectories turn in opposite directions near the two saddle - foci . 
 we show that within the class of divergence - free vector fields that preserve the cycle , tangencies of the invariant manifolds of two hyperbolic saddle - foci densely occur . 
 the global dynamics is persistently dominated by heteroclinic tangencies and by the existence of infinitely many elliptic points coexisting with suspended hyperbolic horseshoes .

 the spectrum of the bright central star is similar to unobscured stars with mk spectral types of o5o6.5 . 
 if this star is on the zero age main sequence , then the derived spectrophotometric distance is considerably smaller than previous estimates . 
 the lyman continuum luminosity of the cluster is a few times that of the trapezium .

"a distributed classification paradigm known as _ collaborative tagging _ has been widely adopted in new web applications designed to manage and share online resources . 
 users of these applications organize resources ( web pages , digital photographs , academic papers ) by associating with them freely chosen text labels , or _ 
 tags_. here we leverage the social aspects of collaborative tagging and introduce a notion of _ resource distance _ based on the collective tagging activity of users . we collect data from a popular system and perform experiments showing that our definition of distance can be used to build a weighted network of resources with a detectable community structure . 
 we show that this community structure clearly exposes the semantic relations among resources . 
 the communities of resources that we observe are a genuinely emergent feature , resulting from the uncoordinated activity of a large number of users , and their detection paves the way to mapping emergent semantics in social tagging systems ."
"in a thin strip of a two - dimensional semiconductor electronic system , spin - orbit coupling may be induced near both edges of the strip due to the substantial spatial variation of the confining potential in the boundary regions . in this paper 
 we show that , in the presence of boundary - confinement induced spin - orbit coupling , a longitudinal charge current circulating through a 2d semiconductor strip may cause _ strong _ non - equilibrium spin accumulation near both edges of the strip . 
 the spins will be polarized along the normal of the 2deg plane but in opposite directions at both edges of the strip . 
 this phenomenon is essentially a kinetic magnetoelectric effect from the theoretical points of view , but it manifests in a very similar form as was conceived in a spin hall effect ."
"as the complexity of deep neural networks ( dnns ) trend to grow to absorb the increasing sizes of data , memory and energy consumption has been receiving more and more attentions for industrial applications , especially on mobile devices . 
 this paper presents a novel structure based on functional hashing to compress dnns , namely funhashnn . for each entry in a deep net , 
 funhashnn uses multiple low - cost hash functions to fetch values in the compression space , and then employs a small reconstruction network to recover that entry . 
 the reconstruction network is plugged into the whole network and trained jointly . 
 funhashnn includes the recently proposed hashednets @xcite as a degenerated case , and benefits from larger value capacity and less reconstruction loss . 
 we further discuss extensions with dual space hashing and multi - hops . on several benchmark datasets , funhashnn demonstrates high compression ratios with little loss on prediction accuracy ."

"we demonstrate an optical fiber fault location method based on the frequency response of the modulated fiber optical backscattered signal in a steady state low - frequency step regime .

 the technique is capable of identifying non - reflective fault events in an optical fiber link and is perfectly compatible with previous methods that focus on the reflective events . 
 the fact that the recuperation of the complex signal is performed in the frequency domain and not via a fourier transform enables the measurements to overcome the spatial resolution limitation of fourier transform incoherent - ofdr measurements even with frequency sweep ranges down to 100 - 100000 hz .

"we investigate two recent parameterizations of the galactic magnetic field with respect to their impact on cosmic nuclei traversing the field .

 in view of the differences resulting from the two field parameterizations as a measure of current knowledge in the galactic field , this rigidity threshold may have to be increased .

 in particular it will be the possible to assess the systematics of type ia supernovae as distance indicator at any redshift .

 the derived signal gradient maps show regions with low mean gradients in structures near the ecliptic poles and higher gradient values in the wide ecliptic equatorial zone , being the result of non - uniform observational time sky coverage . 
 we show that the distinct observational time pattern present in the raw ( cleaned ) data leaves also its imprints on the composite cmb maps . 
 next , studying distribution of the signal dispersion we show that the north - south asymmetry of the wmap signal diminishes with galactic altitude , confirming the earlier conclusions that it possibly reveals galactic foreground effects . as based on these results 
 , one can suspect that the instrumental noise sky distribution and non - removed foregrounds can have affected some of the analyses of the cmb signal . 
 we show that actually the different characteristic axes of the cmb sky distribution derived by numerous authors are preferentially oriented towards some distinguished regions on the sky , defined by the observational time pattern and the galactic plane orientation .

"we discuss the implications of a model of noncommutative quantum mechanics where noncommutativity is extended to the phase space . 
 we analyze how this model affects the problem of the two - dimensional gravitational quantum well and use the latest experimental results for the energy states of neutrons in the earth s gravitational field to establish an upper bound on the fundamental momentum scale introduced by noncommutativity . 
 we show that the configuration space noncommutativity has , in leading order , no effect on the problem and that in the context of the model , a correction to the presently accepted value of planck s constant to @xmath0 part in @xmath1 arises . 
 we also study the transition between quantum and classical behaviour of particles in a gravitational quantum well and analyze how an increase in the particles mass turns the energy spectrum into a continuous one .

"we present a detailed analysis comparing the velocity fields in molecular clouds _ and _ the atomic gas that surrounds them in order to address the origin of the gradients . to that end

 the maps are made from high - resolution observations and 21-cm observations from the leiden / argentine / bonn galactic @xmath0  survey . 
 we find that ( i ) the atomic gas associated with each molecular cloud has a substantial velocity gradient  ranging within 0.02 to 0.07 whether or not the molecular cloud itself has a substantial linear gradient . 
 ( ii ) if the gradients in the molecular and atomic gas were due to rotation , this would imply that the molecular clouds have less specific angular momentum than the surrounding @xmath0  by a factor of 1  6 . 
 ( iii ) most importantly , the velocity gradient position angles in the molecular and atomic gas are generally widely separated  by as much as @xmath1 in the case of the rosette molecular cloud .

"we report on the detection of excess hard x - ray emission from the tev bl lac object mrk  421 during the historical low - flux state of the source in january 2013 . 
 observations were conducted four times between mjd  56294 and mjd  56312 with a total exposure of 80.9ksec . 
 the source flux in the @xmath0kev range was nearly constant except for mjd  56307 , when the average flux level increased by a factor of three . throughout the exposure , 
 the x - ray spectra of mrk  421 were well represented by a steep power - law model with a photon index of @xmath1 , although a significant excess was noted above 20kev in the mjd  56302 data when the source was in its faintest state . 
 moreover , mrk  421 was detected at more than the @xmath2 level in the @xmath3kev count maps for both mjd  56307 and mjd  56302 but not during the remaining two observations . 
 the detected excess hard x - ray emissions connect smoothly with the extrapolation of the high - energy @xmath4-ray continuum of the blazar constrained by during the source quiescence . 
 these findings indicate that , while the overall x - ray spectrum of mrk  421 is dominated by the highest - energy tail of the synchrotron continuum , the variable excess hard x - ray emission above 20kev ( on the timescale of a week ) is related to the inverse compton emission component .

 the coulomb repulsion is found to dominate the behaviour in large parts of the metallic regime . by suppressing charge fluctuations

"we use particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations to study the nonlinear evolution of ion velocity space instabilities in an idealized problem in which a background velocity shear continuously amplifies the magnetic field . 
 we simulate the astrophysically relevant regime where the shear timescale is long compared to the ion cyclotron period , and the plasma beta is @xmath0 . 
 the background field amplification in our calculation is meant to mimic processes such as turbulent fluctuations or mhd - scale instabilities . 
 the field amplification continuously drives a pressure anisotropy with @xmath1 and the plasma becomes unstable to the mirror and ion cyclotron instabilities . in all cases , 
 the nonlinear state is dominated by the mirror instability , not the ion cyclotron instability , and the plasma pressure anisotropy saturates near the threshold for the linear mirror instability . 
 the magnetic field fluctuations initially undergo exponential growth but saturate in a secular phase in which the fluctuations grow on the same timescale as the background magnetic field ( with @xmath2 in the secular phase ) . at early times , the ion magnetic moment is well - conserved but once the fluctuation amplitudes exceed @xmath3 , the magnetic moment is no longer conserved but instead changes on a timescale comparable to that of the mean magnetic field .

 we derive analytical formulas for the fields excited in a finite system , taking explicitly into account the spurious reflections occurring at the artificial system boundaries . 
 the intrinsic parameters of the investigated functional element are found by fitting the results of ms simulations to those obtained from the formulas derived . 
 devices linked with one and two semi - infinite waveguides are analyzed explicitly ; possible extensions of the formalism to more complex circuits are discussed as well .

 pulse - phase spectrosopy indicates that @xmath4 is decreased relative to the phase - averaged value around the primary minimum , where an increase is normally observed .

 only the attractive force of the top condensate should exceed the critical coupling , while other channels such as the bottom and tau condensates should not . 
 we then find that the top condensate can be the mac for @xmath1 , whereas the tau condensation is favored for @xmath2 . 
 the analysis for @xmath3 strongly depends on the regularization scheme .

"one of the central conceptual problems in high @xmath0 superconductivity is to reconcile the abundant evidence for stripe - like physics at ` short ' distances with the equally convincing evidence for bcs - like physics at large distance scales ( the ` nodal fermions ' ) . 
 our central hypothesis is that the duality notion applies : the superconductor should be viewed as a condensate of topological excitations associated with the fully ordered stripe phase . 
 as we will argue , the latter are not only a form of ` straightforward ' spin and charge order but also involve a form of ` hidden ' or ` topological ' long range order which is also responsible for the phenomenon of spin - charge separation in 1 + 1d . 
 the topological excitation associated with the destruction of this hidden order is of the most unusual kind . 
 we suggest that the associated disorder field theory has a geometrical , gravity like structure concurrent with topological phases with no precedent elsewhere ."

 in addition , a weak radio source was found coincident with the optical afterglow . 
 the hst observations reveal that a positionally coincident host galaxy must be the faintest host to date , @xmath1 mag . 
 the afterglow observations can be explained by several models requiring little or no extinction within the host galaxy , @xmath2 mag . 
 these observations have significant implications for the statistics of the so - called dark bursts ( bursts for which no optical afterglow is detected ) , which are usually attributed to dust extinction within the host galaxy . 
 the faintness and relatively rapid decay of the afterglow of , combined with the low inferred extinction indicate that some dark bursts are intrinsically dim and not dust obscured . 
 thus , the diversity in the underlying properties of optical afterglows must be observationally determined before substantive inferences can be drawn from the statistics of dark bursts .

"in this work it is studied the hopfield fermionic spin glass model which allows interpolating from trivial randomness to a highly frustrated regime . 
 therefore , it is possible to investigate whether or not frustration is an essential ingredient which would allow this magnetic disordered model to present naturally inverse freezing by comparing the two limits , trivial randomness and highly frustrated regime and how different levels of frustration could affect such unconventional phase transition . 
 the problem is expressed in the path integral formalism where the spin operators are represented by bilinear combinations of grassmann variables . 
 the grand canonical potential is obtained within the static approximation and one - step replica symmetry breaking scheme . as a result ,

"hard - soft bilayers are analogous to prototype exchange - biased ferromagnetic -antiferromagnetic systems as the minor loop of the soft layer is biased by the hard and furthermore they offer bias layer tunability . in sputtered copt / co hard - soft bilayers we demonstrate that the exchange bias field shows a linear dependence on the hard layer magnetization , while the coercivity shows a quadratic dependence . 
 analysis of the minor hysteresis loop features supported by monte - carlo simulations provide clear evidence that the coercivity of the soft layer is mainly determined by the tunable randomness of the domain state of the hard layer ."
"in this report we present the temperature evolution of magnetic coercivity of graphene oxide ( go ) and reduced graphene oxide ( rgo ) . 
 we report an anamolous decrease in coercivity of go and rgo with decreasing temperature . 
 we could explain this anamolous behavior invoking the inherent presence of ripple in graphene . 
 we observe antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic behavior at room temperature for go and rgo respectively , but at low temperatures both shows paramagnetic behavior ."
"random walks are basic diffusion processes on networks and have applications in , for example , searching , navigation , ranking , and community detection . 
 recent recognition of the importance of temporal aspects on networks spurred studies of random walks on temporal networks . 
 here we theoretically study two types of event - driven random walks on a stochastic temporal network model that produces arbitrary distributions of interevent times . in the so - called active random walk , 
 the interevent time is reinitialized on all links upon each movement of the walker . in the so - called passive random 
 walk , the interevent time is reinitialized only on the link that has been used the last time , and it is a type of correlated random walk . 
 we find that the steady state is always the uniform density for the passive random walk . 
 in contrast , for the active random walk , it increases or decreases with the node s degree depending on the distribution of interevent times . 
 the mean recurrence time of a node is inversely proportional to the degree for both active and passive random walks . 
 furthermore , the mean recurrence time does or does not depend on the distribution of interevent times for the active and passive random walks , respectively ."

"we suggest that jovian planets will survive the late stages of stellar evolution , and that white dwarfs will retain planetary systems in wide orbits ( @xmath0au ) . utilising evolutionary models for jovian planets , 
 we show that infra - red imaging with 8 m class telescopes of suitable nearby white dwarfs should allow us to resolve and detect companions @xmath1 . 
 detection of massive planetary companions to nearby white dwarfs would prove that such objects can survive the final stages of stellar evolution , place constraints on the frequency of main sequence stars with planetary systems dynamically similar to our own and allow direct spectroscopic investigation of their composition and structure .

"intrinsic bilayer graphene is a gapless semimetal . under the application of a bias field it becomes a semiconductor with a direct band gap that is proportional to the applied field . under a layer - asymmetric strain ( where the upper layer undergoes compression and lower layer tension or visa - versa ) we find that the band gap of a biased bilayer graphene ribbon becomes indirect and , for higher strains , becomes negative returning the material its original semimetal state . as a result 
 , the conductivity of the ribbon increases and can be almost an order of magnitude larger that of the intrinsic unbiased material - a change that can be induced with a strain of only @xmath0 . 
 the conductivity is proportional to the applied strain and the magnitude of the effect is tunable with the bias field . 
 such layer - asymmetric strains can be achieved by bending , with forces on the order of @xmath1 resulting in a layer - asymmetric strain of @xmath2 . 
 this new electromechanical effect has a wide potential for application in the areas of nano - force microscopy and pressure sensing on the atomic scale ."
"among the distinguishing characteristics of the remarkable hot r coronae borealis star dy cen , which was recently found to be a spectroscopic binary , is the presence of nebular forbidden lines in its optical spectrum . 
 a compilation of photometry from 1970 to the present suggests that the star has evolved to higher effective temperatures . 
 comparison of spectra from 2010 with earlier spectra show that between 2003 and 2010 , the 6717 and 6730   emission lines of [ sii ] underwent a dramatic change in their fluxes suggesting an increase in the nebula s electron density of 290 @xmath0 to 3140 @xmath0 from 1989 to 2010 while the stellar temperature increased from 19500 k to 25000 k. the nebular radius is about 0.02 pc , 60000 times bigger than the semimajor axis of dy cen binary system . 
 rapid changes of stellar temperature and its response by the nebula demonstrate stellar evolution in action .

"we study the orbital architecture of multi - planet systems detected by the transit mission using n - body simulations , focussing on the orbital spacing between adjacent planets in systems showing four or more transiting planets . 
 we find that the observed spacings are tightly clustered around @xmath0 mutual hill radii , when transit geometry and sensitivity limits are accounted for . in comparison , 
 dynamical integrations reveal that the minimum spacing required for systems of similar masses to survive dynamical instability for as long as a billion years is , @xmath1 if all orbits are circular and coplanar , and @xmath2 if planetary orbits have eccentricities @xmath3 ( a value suggested by studies of planet transit - time - variations ) 
 . this apparent coincidence , between the observed spacing and the theoretical stability threshold , leads us to propose that typical planetary systems were formed with even tighter spacing , but most , except for the widest ones , have undergone dynamical instability , and are pared down to a more anemic version of their former selves , with fewer planets and larger spacings . 
 so while the high multiple systems ( five or more transiting planets ) are primordial systems that remain stable , the single or double planetary systems , abundantly discovered by the mission , may be the descendants of more closely packed high multiple systems . 
 if this hypothesis is correct , we infer that the formation environment of systems should be more dissipative than that of the terrestrial planets ."
"we explore the adsorption of mos@xmath0  on a range of metal substrates by means of first - principles density functional theory calculations . including van der waals forces in the density 
 functional is essential to capture the interaction between mos@xmath0  and a metal surface , and obtain reliable interface potential steps and schottky barriers . 
 special care is taken to construct interface structures that have a mismatch between the mos@xmath0  and the metal lattices of @xmath11% . 
 mos@xmath0  is chemisorbed on the early transition metal ti , which leads to a strong perturbation of its ( electronic ) structure and a pinning of the fermi level 0.54 ev below the mos@xmath0  conduction band due to interface states .

"the interplay between the coupling of an interacting quantum dot to a conduction band and its connection to localized levels has been studied in a triple quantum dot arrangement . 
 the electronic dicke effect , resulting from quasi - resonant states of two side - coupled non - interacting quantum dots , is found to produce important effects on the kondo resonance of the interacting dot . 
 we study in detail the kondo regime of the system by applying a numerical renormalization group analysis to a finite-@xmath0 multi - impurity anderson hamiltonian model . 
 we find an extreme narrowing of the kondo resonance , as the single - particle levels of the side dots are tuned towards the fermi level and  squeeze "" the kondo resonance , accompanied by a strong drop in the kondo temperature , due to the presence of a supertunneling state . 
 further , we show that the kondo temperature _ vanishes _ in the limit of the dicke effect of the structure . by analyzing the magnetic moment and entropy of the three - dot cluster versus temperature , we identify a different _ local _ singlet that competes with the kondo state , resulting in the eventual suppression of the kondo temperature and strongly affecting the spin correlations of the structure . 
 we further show that system asymmetries in couplings , level structure or due to coulomb interactions , result in interesting changes in the spectral function near the fermi level . 
 these strongly affect the kondo temperature and the linear conductance of the system ."

"a new monte - carlo based uncertainty analysis is introduced to quantitatively determine the predictive ability of qcd sum rules . 
 a comprehensive analysis of ground state @xmath0-meson and nucleon spectral properties is performed . 
 many of the findings contradict the conventional wisdom of both practitioners and skeptics alike . 
 associations between the phenomenological fit parameters are particularly interesting as they reveal how the sum rules resolve the spectral properties . 
 the use of derivative sum rules for the determination of @xmath0-meson spectral properties is shown to be a very unfavorable approach . 
 most prior nucleon sum rule analyses are based on a sum rule which is found to be invalid ; the results are suspect , and should be reevaluated . 
 the `` ioffe formula '' , argued by many to qualitatively encapsulate a description of the nucleon mass in terms of the chiral symmetry breaking order parameter @xmath1 is misleading at best .

 we consider standard expressions for pressure and chemical potential applied to this family of coarse - grained models with density - dependent interactions and show that they only provide approximations to the pressure and chemical potential of the underlying original system . 
 these approximations are then carefully compared in two cases : we consider a generic microscopic system in the low - density regime and polymer solutions under good - solvent conditions .

"for a rigid model satellite , chandrasekhar s dynamical friction formula describes the orbital evolution quite accurately , when the coulomb logarithm is chosen appropriately . however , it is not known if the orbital evolution of a real satellite with the internal degree of freedom can be described by the dynamical friction formula . 
 we performed @xmath0-body simulation of the orbital evolution of a self - consistent satellite galaxy within a self - consistent parent galaxy . 
 we found that the orbital decay of the simulated satellite is significantly faster than the estimate from the dynamical friction formula . 
 the main cause of this discrepancy is that the stars stripped out of the satellite are still close to the satellite , and increase the drag force on the satellite through two mechanisms . 
 one is the direct drag force from particles in the trailing tidal arm , a non - axisymmetric force that slows the satellite down . 
 the other is the indirect effect that is caused by the particles remaining close to the satellite after escape . 
 the force from them enhances the wake caused in the parent galaxy by dynamical friction , and this larger wake in turn slows the satellite down more than expected from the contribution of its bound mass . 
 we found these two have comparable effects , and the combined effect can be as large as 20% of the total drag force on the satellite ."

 these @xmath2 constraints are now more restrictive than those that follow from current type ia supernova ( snia ) apparent magnitude measurements @xcite .

 we provide a unified framework which brings together a variety of methods which have been introduced in different communities within the mathematical sciences . 
 we study probit classification @xcite , generalize the level - set method for bayesian inverse problems @xcite to the classification setting , and generalize the ginzburg - landau optimization - based classifier @xcite to a bayesian setting ; we also show that the probit and level set approaches are natural relaxations of the harmonic function approach introduced in @xcite . 
 we introduce efficient numerical methods , suited to large data - sets , for both mcmc - based sampling as well as gradient - based map estimation . through numerical experiments we study classification accuracy and uncertainty quantification for our models ; these experiments showcase a suite of datasets commonly used to evaluate graph - based semi - supervised learning algorithms .

"the lick agn monitoring project 2011 observing campaign was carried out over the course of 11 weeks in spring 2011 . here 
 we present the first results from this program , a measurement of the broad - line reverberation lag in the seyfert 1 galaxy mrk 50 . combining our data with supplemental observations obtained prior to the start of the main observing campaign , 
 our dataset covers a total duration of 4.5 months . during this time , 
 mrk 50 was highly variable , exhibiting a maximum variability amplitude of a factor of @xmath0 in the @xmath1-band continuum and a factor of @xmath2 in the h@xmath3  line . using standard cross - correlation techniques 
 , we find that h@xmath3  and h@xmath4  lag the @xmath5-band continuum by @xmath6 and @xmath7 days , respectively , while the lag of @xmath8 is unresolved . 
 the h@xmath3  line exhibits a symmetric velocity - resolved reverberation signature with shorter lags in the high - velocity wings than in the line core , consistent with an origin in a broad - line region dominated by orbital motion rather than infall or outflow . 
 assuming a virial normalization factor of @xmath9 , the virial estimate of the black hole mass is @xmath10 @xmath11 . 
 these observations demonstrate that mrk 50 is among the most promising nearby active galaxies for detailed investigations of broad - line region structure and dynamics ."

"the aperture mass has been shown in a series of recent publications to be a useful quantitative tool for weak lensing studies , ranging from cosmic shear to the detection of a mass - selected sample of dark matter haloes . 
 quantitative analytical predictions for the aperture mass have been based on a number of simplifying assumptions . in this paper , we test the reliability of these assumptions and the quality of the analytic approximations , using ray - tracing simulations through a cosmological density field generated by very large n - body simulations . 
 we find that those analytic predictions which take into account the non - linear evolution of the matter distribution , such as the dispersion of the aperture mass and the halo abundance , are surprisingly accurately reproduced with our numerical results , whereas the predictions for the skewness , based on quasi - linear theory , are rather imprecise . 
 in particular , we verify numerically that the probability distribution of the aperture mass decreases exponentially for values much larger than the rms . given the good overall agreement , 
 comparisons between the observed distribution of the aperture mass and the theoretical values provide a powerful tool for testing cosmological models .

"in this work , one shows that a specific non - minimal coupling between the scalar curvature and matter can mimic the dark matter component of galaxy clusters . for this purpose 
 , one assesses the abell cluster a586 , a massive nearby relaxed cluster of galaxies in virial equilibrium , where direct mass estimates and strong - lensing determinations are possible . 
 one then extends the dark matter mimicking to a large sample of galaxy clusters whose density profiles are obtained from the _ chandra _ high quality data , also in virial equilibrium . 
 the total density , which generally follows a cusped profile and reveals a very small baryonic component , can be effectively described within this framework ."

"we present the findings of our weak lensing study of a sample of 116 cnoc2 galaxy groups . 
 the lensing signal is used to estimate the mass - to - light ratio of these galaxy groups . the best fit isothermal sphere model to our lensing data has an einstein radius of 088@xmath0012 , which corresponds to a shear - weighted velocity dispersion of 245@xmath018 km s@xmath1 . 
 the mean mass - to - light ratio within 1 h@xmath1 mpc is 185@xmath028 hm@xmath2/l@xmath3 and is independent of radius from the group center . 
 the signal - to - noise ratio of the shear measurement is sufficient to split the sample into subsets of `` poor '' and `` rich '' galaxy groups . 
 the poor galaxy groups were found to have an average velocity dispersion of 193@xmath4 km s@xmath1 and a mass - to - light ratio of 134@xmath026 hm@xmath5/l@xmath3 , while the rich galaxy groups have a velocity dispersion of 270@xmath6 km s@xmath1 and a mass - to - light ratio of 278@xmath042 hm@xmath5/l@xmath3 , similar to the mass - to - light ratio of clusters . this steep increase in the mass - to - light ratio as a function of mass , suggests that the mass scale of @xmath7m@xmath5 is where the transition between the actively star - forming field environment and the passively - evolving cluster environment occurs . 
 this is the first such detection from weak lensing ."
"we demonstrate that the entropy of entanglement and the distillable entanglement of regions with respect to the rest of a general harmonic lattice system in the ground or a thermal state scale at most as the boundary area of the region . this area law is rigorously proven to hold true in non - critical harmonic lattice system of arbitrary spatial dimension , for general finite - ranged harmonic interactions , regions of arbitrary shape and states of nonzero temperature . for nearest - neighbor interactions

 these higher dimensional analogues of the analysis of block entropies in the one - dimensional case show that under general conditions , one can expect an area law for the entanglement in non - critical harmonic many - body systems . 
 the proofs make use of methods from entanglement theory , as well as of results on matrix functions of block banded matrices . 
 disordered systems are also considered . 
 we moreover construct a class of examples for which the two - point correlation length diverges , yet still an area law can be proven to hold . 
 we finally consider the scaling of classical correlations in a classical harmonic system and relate it to a quantum lattice system with a modified interaction . 
 we briefly comment on a general relationship between criticality and area laws for the entropy of entanglement ."
"this paper presents a quantification of the x - ray variability amplitude for 79  observations of 36 seyfert 1 galaxies . 
 we find that consideration of sources with the narrowest permitted lines in the optical band introduces scatter into the established correlation between x - ray variability and nuclear luminosity . 
 consideration of the x - ray spectral index and variability properties together shows distinct groupings in parameter space for broad and narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies , confirming previous studies . 
 a strong correlation is found between hard x - ray variability and fwhm h@xmath0 . 
 a range of nuclear mass and accretion rate across the seyfert population can explain the differences observed in x - ray and optical properties . 
 an attractive alternative model , which does not depend on any systematic difference in central mass , is that the circumnuclear gas of nlsy1s is different to blsy1s in temperature , optical depth , density or geometry .

"low temperature quantum corrections to the density of states ( dos ) and the conductivity are examined for a two  dimensional(2d ) square crystal with substitutional impurities . by summing the leading logarithmic corrections to the dos its energy dependence near half 
 filling is obtained . 
 it is shown that substitutional impurities do not suppress the van hove singularity at the middle of the band , however they change its energy dependence strongly . 
 weak disorder due to substitutional impurities in the three  dimensional simple cubic lattice results in a shallow dip in the center of the band . 
 the calculation of quantum corrections to the conductivity of a 2d lattice shows that the well  known logarithmic localization correction exists for all band fillings . 
 furthermore the magnitude of the correction increases as half  filling is approached . 
 the evaluation of the obtained analytical results shows evidence for delocalized states in the center of the band of a 2d lattice with substitutional impurities ."

 such a quantitative analysis indicates that the transmitted and reflected probe beam components and their respective phase shifts can be easily controlled and optimized ."

"we consider the quantum vacuum of fermionic field in the presence of a black - hole background as a possible candidate for the stabilized black hole . the stable vacuum state ( as well as thermal equilibrium states with arbitrary temperature ) can exist if we use the painlev - gullstrand description of the black hole , and the superluminal dispersion of the particle spectrum at high energy , which is introduced in the free - falling frame . 
 such choice is inspired by the analogy between the quantum vacuum and the ground state of quantum liquid , in which the event horizon for the low - energy fermionic quasiparticles also can arise . 
 the quantum vacuum is characterized by the fermi surface , which appears behind the event horizon . 
 we do not consider the back reaction , and thus there is no guarantee that the stable black hole exists . 
 but if it does exist , the fermi surface behind the horizon would be the necessary attribute of its vacuum state . 
 we also consider exact discrete spectrum of fermions inside the horizon which allows us to discuss the problem of fermion zero modes ."
"collisionless n - body simulations of merging disk - galaxies with mass ratios ( @xmath0 ) of 1:1 , 2:1 , 3:1 , and 4:1 have been performed using direct summation with the special purpose hardware grape .

 the photometric , kinematical and isophotal properties of the merger remnants are investigated and turn out to be in very good agreement with observations of giant elliptical galaxies . we conclude that equal mass mergers lead to slowly rotating , anisotropic remnants having predominantly boxy isophotes . 
 mergers with a mass ratio of 3:1 and 4:1 , on the other hand , are fast isotropic rotators with disky isophotes .

"the onset of spiral structure in galaxies appears to occur between redshifts 1.4 and 1.8 when disks have developed a cool stellar component , rotation dominates over turbulent motions in the gas , and massive clumps become less frequent . during the transition from clumpy to spiral disks , 
 two unusual types of spirals are found in the hubble ultra deep field that are massive , clumpy and irregular like their predecessor clumpy disks , yet spiral - like or sheared like their descendants . 
 one type is `` woolly '' with massive clumpy arms all over the disk and is brighter than other disk galaxies at the same redshift , while another type has irregular multiple arms with high pitch angles , star formation knots and no inner symmetry like today s multiple - arm galaxies . 
 the common types of spirals seen locally are also present in a redshift range around @xmath0 , namely grand design with two symmetric arms , multiple arm with symmetry in the inner parts and several long , thin arms in the outer parts , and flocculent , with short , irregular and patchy arms that are mostly from star formation . 
 normal multiple arm galaxies are found only closer than @xmath1 in the udf . 
 grand design galaxies extend furthest to @xmath2 , presumably because interactions can drive a two - arm spiral in a disk that would otherwise have a more irregular structure . 
 the difference between these types is understandable in terms of the usual stability parameters for gas and stars , and the ratio of the velocity dispersion to rotation speed ."

 both models share important features with large eukaryotic cells : they employ small diffusible molecules and involve receptor subunits resembling highly conserved g - protein cascades .

"tadpole galaxies look like a star forming head with a tail structure to the side . they are also named cometaries . in a series of recent works 
 we have discovered a number of issues that lead us to consider them extremely interesting targets . 
 first , from images , they are disks with a lopsided starburst . 
 this result is firmly established with long slit spectroscopy in a nearby representative sample . 
 they rotate with the head following the rotation pattern but displaced from the rotation center . moreover , in a search for extremely metal poor ( xmp ) galaxies , we identified tadpoles as the dominant shapes in the sample 
 nearly 80% of the local xmp galaxies have a tadpole morphology . 
 in addition , the spatially resolved analysis of the metallicity shows the remarkable result that there is a metallicity drop right at the position of the head . 
 this is contrary to what intuition would say and difficult to explain if star formation has happened from gas processed in the disk . 
 the result could however be understood if the star formation is driven by pristine gas falling into the galaxy disk . 
 if confirmed , we could be unveiling , for the first time , cool flows in action in our nearby world . 
 the tadpole class is relatively frequent at high redshift 
 10% of resolvable galaxies in the hubble udf 
 but less than 1% in the local universe . 
 they are systems that could track cool flows and test models of galaxy formation .    2"

 it admits as many new sessions as possible in observance of the agreements , even under intense workload variations .

 our procedure is an improvement of the cramr - rao lower bound .

 the analysis indicates the possibility of constraining deviations from gr in inspiral snr ( @xmath1 ) regimes that are achievable in upcoming scientific runs ( gw150914 had an inspiral snr @xmath2 ) . the errors on @xmath3 also increase errors of other parameters such as the chirp mass @xmath4 and symmetric mass ratio @xmath5 .

 we show that the `` pure '' exciton condensation without lattice distortion is difficult to realize under the poor nesting condition of the underlying fermi surface . 
 furthermore , by systematically calculating the momentum resolved hybridization between the two bands , we examine the character of electron - hole pairing from the viewpoint of bcs - bec crossover within the cdw phase and find that the strong - coupling bec - like pairing dominates . 
 we therefore propose that the cdw phase observed in 1@xmath0-tise@xmath1 originates from a bec - like electron - hole pairing ."
"we explore a technique for identifying the highest redshift ( @xmath0 ) sources in _ herschel_/spire and blast submillimeter surveys by localizing the position of the far - infrared dust peak . just as _ 
 spitzer_/irac was used to identify stellar ` bump ' sources , the far - ir peak is also a redshift indicator ; although , the latter also depends on the average dust temperature . 
 we demonstrate the wide range of allowable redshifts for a reasonable range of dust temperatures and show that it is impossible to constraint the redshift of individual objects using solely the position of the far - ir peak . by fitting spectral energy distribution models to simulated _ herschel_/spire photometry we show the utility of radio and/or far - infrared data in breaking this degeneracy . with prior knowledge of the dust temperature distribution 
 it is possible to obtain statistical samples of high redshift submillimeter galaxy candidates . 
 we apply this technique to the blast survey of ecdfs to constrain the number of dusty galaxies at @xmath0 . 
 we find @xmath1 galaxies with flux density ratios of @xmath2 ; this sets an upper limit of @xmath3deg@xmath4 if we assume all are at @xmath0 . 
 this is @xmath5% of all 500@xmath6m - selected galaxies down to s@xmath7mjy ( @xmath8 for @xmath0 ) . 
 modeling with conventional temperature and redshift distributions estimates the percentage of these 500@xmath6 m peak galaxies at @xmath0 to be between 1085% . 
 our results are consistent with other estimates of the number density of very high redshift submillimeter galaxies and follows the decline in the star formation rate density at @xmath0 ."
"we introduce a model of a dual - core optical waveguide with opposite signs of the group - velocity - dispersion ( gvd ) in the two cores , and a phase - velocity mismatch between them . the coupler is embedded into an active host medium , which provides for the linear coupling of a gain - loss type between the two cores . 
 the same system can be derived , without phenomenological assumptions , by considering the three - wave propagation in a medium with the quadratic nonlinearity , provided that the depletion of the second - harmonic pump is negligible . 
 this linear system offers an optical realization of the charge - parity ( @xmath0 ) symmetry , while the addition of the intra - core cubic nonlinearity breaks the symmetry . by means of direct simulations and analytical approximations 
 , it is demonstrated that the linear system generates expanding gaussian states , while the nonlinear one gives rise to broad oscillating solitons , as well as a general family of stable stationary gap solitons ."
"we summarize the recent theoretical and numerical works on spin turbulence ( st ) in spin-1 spinor bose - einstein condensates . 
 when the system is excited from the ground state , it goes through hydrodynamic instability to st in which the spin density vector has various disordered direction .

 st has some characteristics different from other kinds of turbulence in quantum fluids . 
 firstly , the spectrum of the spin - dependent interaction energy exhibits the characteristic power law different from the usual kolmogorov -5/3 law . 
 secondly , st can show the spin - glass - like behavior ; the spin density vectors are spatially random but temporally frozen ."
"optical and near - infrared observations of the grb990705 error box were carried out with eso telescopes at la silla and paranal in chile and with the noao spirex 0.6-meter telescope in antarctica . 
 we detected the counterpart of this grb in the near - infrared @xmath0 band and optical @xmath1 band . 
 the power - law decline of the near - infrared lightcurve is rather steep with a decay index @xmath2 @xmath3 1.7 in the first hours , and a possible steepening after one day . 
 broadband spectral analysis of the optical / near - infrared afterglow suggests that this grb took place in a high density environment . a deep optical image obtained at antu ( vlt - ut1 ) about 5 days after the grb trigger shows at the position of the transient an extended object which might be the host galaxy of grb990705 ."

"dirac ( distributed infrastructure with remote agent control ) is a general framework for the management of tasks over distributed heterogeneous computing environments .

"a population of x - ray dominated gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) observed by _ ginga _ , _ bepposax _  and _ hete-2_should be represented in the batse  data as presumably soft bursts . 
 we have performed a search for soft grbs in the batse  records in the 25100 kev energy band . 
 a softness of a burst spectrum can be a reason why it has been missed by the on - board procedure and previous searches for untriggered grbs tuned to 50300 kev range . 
 we have found a surprisingly small number ( @xmath0 yr@xmath1 down to 0.1 ph @xmath2 s@xmath1 ) of soft grbs where the count rate is dominated by 2550 kev energy channel . 
 this fact as well as the analysis of _ hete-2 _  and common _ 
 bepposax_/batse  grbs indicates that the majority of grbs with a low @xmath3 has a relatively hard tail with the high - energy power - law photon index @xmath4 .

"the drift velocity in drift tubes of the cms muon chambers is a key parameter for the muon track reconstruction and trigger . 
 it needs to be monitored precisely in order to detect any deviation from its nominal value . 
 a change in absolute pressure , a variation of the gas admixture or a contamination of the chamber gas by air affect the drift velocity . 
 furthermore , the temperature and magnetic field influence its value . 
 first data , taken with a dedicated velocity drift chamber ( vdc ) built by rwth aachen iiia are presented . 
 another important parameter to be monitored is the pressure inside the muon drift tube chambers . 
 the differential pressure must not exceed a certain value and the absolute pressure has to be kept slightly above ambient pressure to prevent air from entering into the muon drift tube chambers in case of a leak . 
 latest drift velocity monitoring results are discussed ."
"a macronova ( kilonova ) was discovered with a short gamma - ray burst , grb 130603b , which is widely believed to be powered by the radioactivity of @xmath0-process elements synthesized in the ejecta of a neutron star binary merger . as an alternative 
 , we propose that macronovae are energized by the central engine , i.e. , a black hole or neutron star , and the injected energy is emitted after the adiabatic expansion of ejecta . 
 this engine model is motivated by extended emission of short grbs . in order to compare the theoretical models with observations , we develop analytical formulae for the light curves of macronovae . 
 the engine model allows a wider parameter range , especially smaller ejecta mass , and better fit to observations than the @xmath0-process model . 
 future observations of electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational waves should distinguish energy sources and constrain the activity of central engine and the @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis ."
"accretion - powered x - ray pulsars are among the most luminous x - ray sources in the galaxy . however , despite decades of theoretical and observational work since their discovery , no satisfactory model for the formation of the observed x - ray spectra has emerged . in particular , the previously available theories are unable to reproduce the power - law variation observed at high energies in many sources . in this paper , we present the first self - consistent calculation of the spectrum emerging from a pulsar accretion column that includes an explicit treatment of the energization occurring in the shock . using a rigorous eigenfunction expansion method based on the exact dynamical solution for the velocity profile in the column , we obtain a closed - form expression for the green s function describing the upscattering of radiation injected into the column from a monochromatic source located at the top of the thermal mound , near the base of the flow . 
 the green s function is convolved with a planck distribution to calculate the radiation spectrum resulting from the reprocessing of blackbody photons emitted by the thermal mound . 
 we demonstrate that the energization of the photons in the shock naturally produces an x - ray spectrum with a power - law shape at high energies and a blackbody shape at low energies , in agreement with many observations of accreting x - ray pulsars ."
"we show how to switch on and off the ratchet potential of a collective brownian motor , depending only on the position of the particles , in order to attain a current higher than or at least equal to that induced by any periodic flashing . 
 maximization of instant velocity turns out to be the optimal protocol for one particle but is nevertheless defeated by a periodic switching when a sufficiently large ensemble of particles is considered . 
 the protocol presented in this letter , although not the optimal one , yields approximately the same current as the optimal protocol for one particle and as the optimal periodic switching for an infinite number of them ."
"ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) with x - ray luminosities larger than the eddington luminosity of stellar mass objects may be powered by intermediate mass black holes ( ibhs ) of masses @xmath0 . 
 if ibhs form in young dense stellar clusters , they can be fed by roche lobe overflow from a tidally captured massive ( @xmath1 ) stellar companion . after the donor leaves the main sequence it forms a compact remnant , which spirals in due to gravitational wave ( gw ) emission . 
 we show that space based detectors such as the _ laser interferometer space antenna _ are likely to detect several of these sources . 
 gw sources stemming from this scenario have small eccentricities which give distinct gw signals . 
 detection of such a gw signal will unambiguously prove the existence of ibhs , and support the hypothesis that some ulxs are powered by ibhs with captured companions .

"we use information entropy to test the isotropy in the nearby galaxy distribution mapped by the two micron all - sky redshift survey ( 2mrs ) . we find that the galaxy distribution is highly anisotropic on small scales . 
 the radial anisotropy gradually decreases with increasing length scales and the observed anisotropy is consistent with that expected for an isotropic poisson distribution beyond a length scale of @xmath0 . using mock catalogues from n - body simulations , we find that the galaxy distribution in the 2mrs exhibits a degree of anisotropy compatible with that of the @xmath1cdm model after accounting for the clustering bias of the 2mrs galaxies . 
 we also quantify the polar and azimuthal anisotropies and identify two directions @xmath2 , @xmath3 which are significantly anisotropic compared to the other directions in the sky . 
 we suggest that their preferential orientations on the sky may indicate a possible alignment of the local group with two nearby large scale structures . despite the differences in the degree of anisotropy on small scales , we find that the galaxy distributions in both the 2mrs and the @xmath1cdm model are isotropic on a scale of @xmath0 .

"of the known pulsar wind nebulae , 8 are good candidates for being in the early stage of evolution where the wind nebula is interacting with the freely expanding supernova ejecta . 
 several of these have been identified with historical supernovae . 
 although the identification of sn 1181 with 3c 58 has been thought to be relatively secure , the large size of the nebula , the amount of swept up mass , and the internal energy indicate a larger age . for g11.20.3 , 
 the nebular size and internal energy are consistent with the identification with the possible supernova of 386 . 
 although the crab nebula appears to have approximate energy equipartition between particles and the magnetic field , the nebulae 3c 58 and msh 1552 appear to be particle dominated . 
 the low magnetic field is consistent with models in which the nebulae are created by a shocked pulsar wind .

 a partial identification of the np can be achieved through the measurements of a forward - backward - like asymmetry , a top - quark - spin - dependent asymmetry , the partial rate asymmetry , and a triple - product asymmetry .

"the anisotropic kondo necklace model in 2d and 3d is treated as a genuine model for magnetic to kondo singlet quantum phase transitions in the heavy fermion ( hf ) compounds . 
 the variation of the quantum critical point ( qcp ) with anisotropy parameters has been investigated previously in the zero field case @xcite . here 
 we extend the treatment to finite fields using a generalised bond operator representation including all triplet states . 
 the variation of critical t@xmath0 with magnetic field and the associated phase diagram is derived . 
 the influence of anisotropies and the different g - factors for localised and itinerant spins on the field dependence of t@xmath0 is also investigated . 
 it is found that three different types of behaviour may appear : ( i ) destruction of antiferromangetism and appearance of a singlet state above a critical field .

"we define the _ violation fraction _ @xmath0 as the cumulative fraction of time that the entropy change is negative during single realizations of processes in phase space . 
 this quantity depends both on the number of degrees of freedom @xmath1 and the duration of the time interval @xmath2 . in the large-@xmath2 and large-@xmath1

 the exponent @xmath4 is positive and generally depends on the protocol for the external driving forces , being @xmath5 for a constant drive . as an example , we study a nontrivial model where the fluctuations of the entropy production are non - gaussian : an elastic line driven at a constant rate by an anharmonic trap . in this case we show that the scaling of @xmath6 with @xmath1 and @xmath2 agrees with our result .

"we present a simple mathematical framework for the description of the dynamics of glassy systems in terms of a random walk in a complex energy landscape pictured as a network of minima . 
 we show how to use the tools developed for the study of dynamical processes on complex networks , in order to go beyond mean - field models that consider that all minima are connected to each other . 
 we consider several possibilities for the transition rates between minima , and show that in all cases the existence of a glassy phase depends on a delicate interplay between the network s topology and the relationship between energy and degree of a minimum . 
 interestingly , the network s degree correlations and the details of the transition rates do not play any role in the existence ( nor in the value ) of the transition temperature , but have an impact only on more involved properties . for glauber or metropolis rates in particular , we find that the low - temperature phase can be further divided into two regions with different scaling properties of the average trapping time . 
 overall , our results rationalize and link the empirical findings about correlations between the energy of the minima and their degree , and should stimulate further investigations on this issue ."

"the task of monte carlo simulation of the evolution of the parton distributions in qcd and of constructing new parton shower monte carlo algorithms requires new way of organizing solutions of the qcd evolution equations , in which quark@xmath0gluon transitions on one hand and quark@xmath0quark or gluon@xmath0gluon transitions ( pure gluonstrahlung ) on the other hand , are treated separately and differently . 
 this requires certain reorganization of the iterative solutions of the qcd evolution equations and leads to what we refer to as a _ hierarchic iterative solutions _ of the evolution equations .

"the explosion mechanism of broad - lined type ic supernovae ( sne ic - bl ) is not very well understood despite their discovery more than two decades ago . recently a serious confrontation of sne ic - bl with the magnetar ( plus @xmath0ni ) model was carried out following previous suggestions . 
 strong evidence for magnetar formation was found for the well - observed sne ic - bl 1998bw and 2002ap . in this paper 
 we systematically study a large sample of sne ic - bl not associated with gamma - ray bursts . 
 we use photospheric velocity data determined in a self - consistent way , which is an improvement to previous methods that suffered from large inconsistencies . 
 we find that the magnetar+@xmath1ni model provides a good description of the light curves and velocity evolution of our sample of sne ic - bl , although some sne ( not all ) can also be described by the pure - magnetar model or by the pure-@xmath0ni ( two - component ) model . in the magnetar model , 
 the amount of @xmath0ni required to explain their luminosity is significantly reduced , and the derived initial explosion energy is , in general , in accordance with neutrino heating .

"we establish the existence of fixed points for certain gauge theories candidate to be magnetic duals of qcd with one adjoint weyl fermion . in the perturbative regime of the magnetic theory 
 the existence of a very large number of fixed points is unveiled . 
 we classify them by analyzing their basin of attraction . 
 the existence of several nonsupersymmetric fixed points for the magnetic gauge theory lends further support towards the existence of gauge - gauge duality beyond supersymmetry . 
 we also discover that among these very many fixed points there are supersymmetric ones emerging from a generic nonsupersymmetric renormalization group flow . 
 we therefore conclude that supersymmetry naturally emerges as a fixed point theory from a nonsupersymmetric lagrangian without the need for fine - tuning of the bare couplings . 
 our results suggest that supersymmetry can be viewed as an emergent phenomenon in field theory . 
 in particular there should be no need for fine - tuning the bare couplings when performing lattice simulations aimed to investigate supersymmetry on the lattice ."
"in this work we use cosmography to alleviate the degeneracy among cosmological models , proposing a way to parameterize matter and dark energy in terms of cosmokinematics quantities . 
 the recipe of using cosmography allows to expand observable quantities in taylor series and to directly compare those expansions with data . 
 we adopt this strategy and we propose a fully self - consistent parametrization of the total energy density driving the late time universe speed up . 
 afterwards , we describe a feasible _ cosmographic dark energy model _ , in which matter is fixed whereas dark energy evolves by means of the cosmographic series . 
 our technique provides robust constraints on cosmokinematic parameters , permitting one to separately bound matter from dark energy densities . 
 our cosmographic dark energy model turns out to be one parameter only , but differently from the @xmath0cdm paradigm , it does not contain ansatz on the dark energy form . 
 in addition , we even determine the free parameter of our model in suitable @xmath1 intervals through monte carlo analyses based on the metropolis algorithm . 
 we compare our results with the standard concordance model and we find that our treatment seems to indicate that dark energy slightly evolves in time , reducing to a pure cosmological constant only as @xmath2 ."
"in topology inference from data , current approaches face two major problems . 
 one concerns the selection of a correct parameter to build an appropriate complex on top of the data points ; the other involves with the typical ` large ' size of this complex . 
 we address these two issues in the context of inferring homology from sample points of a smooth manifold of known dimension sitting in an euclidean space @xmath0 . 
 we show that , for a sample size of @xmath1 points , we can identify a set of @xmath2 points ( as opposed to @xmath3 voronoi vertices ) approximating a subset of the medial axis that suffices to compute a distance sandwiched between the well known _ local feature size _ and the local _ weak feature size _ 
 ( in fact , the approximating set can be further reduced in size to @xmath4 ) . 
 this distance , called the _ 
 lean feature size _ , helps pruning the input set at least to the level of local feature size while making the data locally uniform . 
 the local uniformity in turn helps in building a complex for homology inference on top of the sparsified data without requiring any user - supplied distance threshold . unlike most topology inference results , ours does not require that the input is dense relative to a _ 
 global _ feature such as _ reach _ or _ weak feature size _ ; instead it can be adaptive with respect to the local feature size . 
 we present some empirical evidence in support of our theoretical claims ."

 the x - ray image is extended and its peak position is shifted from the core of the molecular cloud toward the galactic center by about 12 arcminute . the x - ray spectrum and the morphology 
 are well reproduced by a scenario that x - rays from an external source located in the galactic center direction are scattered by the molecular cloud sgr  b2 , and come into our line of sight . thus sgr  b2 may be called an _ x - ray reflection nebula_. possible implications of the galactic center activity related to this unique source are presented ."
"we consider langevin dynamics associated with a modified kinetic energy vanishing for small momenta . 
 this allows us to freeze slow particles , and hence avoid the re - computation of inter - particle forces , which leads to computational gains .

 the aim of this work is first to prove the ergodicity of the modified langevin dynamics ( which fails to be hypoelliptic ) , and next to analyze how the asymptotic variance on ergodic averages depends on the parameters of the modified kinetic energy . 
 numerical results illustrate the approach , both for low - dimensional systems where we resort to a galerkin approximation of the generator , and for more realistic systems using monte carlo simulations ."

 we consider nfw profiles , and find that large scale structure is a major source of uncertainty for most practical situations , when a model , with the mass @xmath0 and the concentration parameter @xmath1 as free parameters , is fit to the observations . 
 we find that the best constraints are found for clusters at intermediate redshifts @xmath2 . for a cluster at @xmath3 , 
 optimal results are obtained when the lensing signal is measured out to @xmath4 arcminutes . 
 measurements at larger radii do not improve the accuracy with which the profile can be determined , contrary to what is expected when the contribution from large scale structure is ignored . the true uncertainties in @xmath0 and the concentration parameter @xmath1 are @xmath5 times larger than when distant large scale structure is not included in the error budget .

"we consider the rotation of neutrally buoyant axisymmetric particles suspended in isotropic turbulence 
 . using laboratory experiments as well as numerical and analytical calculations , we explore how particle rotation depends upon particle shape . 
 we find that shape strongly affects orientational trajectories , but that it has negligible effect on the variance of the particle angular velocity . 
 previous work has shown that shape significantly affects the variance of the tumbling rate of axisymmetric particles . 
 it follows that shape affects the spinning rate in a way that is , on average , complementary to the shape - dependence of the tumbling rate . 
 we confirm this relationship using direct numerical simulations , showing how tumbling rate and spinning rate variances show complementary trends for rod - shaped and disk - shaped particles . 
 we also consider a random but non - turbulent flow . 
 this allows us to explore which of the features observed for rotation in turbulent flow are due to the effects of particle alignment in vortex tubes ."
"the quantum transport through nanoscale junctions is governed by the charging energy @xmath0 of the device . 
 we employ the recently developed scattering - states numerical renormalization group approach to open quantum systems to study nonequilibrium green s functions and current - voltage characteristics of such junctions for small and intermediate values of @xmath0 . 
 we establish the accuracy of the approach by a comparison with diagrammatic kadanoff - baym - keldysh results which become exact in the weak coupling limit @xmath1 . 
 we demonstrate the limits of the diagrammatic expansions at intermediate values of the charging energy . while the numerical renormalization group approach correctly predicts only one single , universal low - energy scale at zero bias voltage , some diagrammatic expansions yield two different low - energy scales for the magnetic and the charge fluctuations . at large voltages , however , the self - consistent second born as well as the gw approximation reproduce the scattering - states renormalization group spectral functions for symmetric junctions , while for asymmetric junctions the voltage - dependent redistribution of spectral weight differs significantly in the different approaches . 
 the second - order perturbation theory does not capture the correct single - particle dynamics at large bias and violates current conservation for asymmetric junctions ."
"this work aims at combining adaptive protocol design , utility maximization and stochastic geometry . 
 we focus on a spatial adaptation of aloha within the framework of ad hoc networks . 
 we consider quasi - static networks in which mobiles learn the local topology and incorporate this information to adapt their medium access probability  ( map ) selection to their local environment . 
 we consider the cases where nodes cooperate in a distributed way to maximize the global throughput or to achieve either proportional fair or max - min fair medium access . in the proportional fair case , 
 we show that nodes can compute their optimal maps as solutions to certain fixed point equations . in the maximum throughput case 
 , the optimal maps are obtained through a gibbs sampling based algorithm . in the max min case , 
 these are obtained as the solution of a convex optimization problem . 
 the main performance analysis result of the paper is that this type of distributed adaptation can be analyzed using stochastic geometry in the proportional fair case . in this case , we show that , when the nodes form a homogeneous poisson point process in the euclidean plane , the distribution of the optimal map can be obtained from that of a certain shot noise process w.r.t . the node poisson point process and that the mean utility can also be derived from this distribution . 
 we discuss the difficulties to be faced for analyzing the performance of the other cases ( maximal throughput and max - min fairness ) . 
 numerical results illustrate our findings and quantify the gains brought by spatial adaptation in such networks ."
"the _ cobe _ firas data contain foreground emission from interplanetary , galactic interstellar dust and extragalactic background emission .

"bloch oscillations appear for a particle in a weakly tilted periodic potential . 
 the intrinsic spin hall effect is an outcome of a spin - orbit coupling . 
 we demonstrate that both these phenomena can be realized simultaneously in a gas of weakly interacting ultracold atoms exposed to a tilted optical lattice and to a set of spatially dependent light fields inducing an effective spin - orbit coupling . 
 it is found that both the spin hall as well as the bloch oscillation effects may coexist , showing , however , a strong correlation between the two . 
 these correlations are manifested as a transverse spin current oscillating in - phase with the bloch oscillations . on top of the oscillations originating from the periodicity of the model , 
 a trembling motion is found which is believed to be atomic _ zitterbewegung_. it is argued that damping of these zitterbewegung oscillations may to a large extent be prevented in the present setup considering a periodic optical lattice potential ."

 the models are 2.5-dimensional , include an energy balance condition , and calculate the radiation field as a function of position near an optically thick accretion disk . 
 the model results show that centrifugal forces produce collisions of streamlines in the disk wind which in turn generate an enhanced density region , underlining the necessity of two dimensional calculations where these forces may be represented . for disk luminosity @xmath0 , white dwarf mass @xmath1 , and white dwarf radii @xmath2 , we obtain a wind mass - loss rate of @xmath3 , and a terminal velocity of @xmath4 . 
 the line profiles we obtain are consistent with observations in their general form , in particular in the maximum absorption at roughly half the terminal velocity for the blue - shifted component , in the magnitudes of the wind velocities implied by the absorption components , in the fwhm of the emission components , and in the strong dependence in inclination angle ."
"over the past few years it has been discovered that an `` observable '' can be set up on the lattice which obeys the discrete cauchy - riemann equations . 
 the ensuing condition of discrete holomorphicity leads to a system of linear equations which can be solved to yield the boltzmann weights of the underlying lattice model . 
 surprisingly , these are the well known boltzmann weights which satisfy the star - triangle or yang - baxter equations at criticality . this connection has been observed for a number of exactly solved models .

"we report on the long - term evolution of the spin period of the symbiotic x - ray pulsar gx  1 + 4 and a possible interpretation within a model of quasi - spherical accretion . 
 new period measurements from bepposax , integral and fermi observations have been combined with previously published data from four decades of observations . during 
 the 1970 s gx  1 + 4 was spinning up with the fastest rate among the known x - ray pulsars at the time . in the mid 1980 s it underwent a change during a period of low x - ray flux and started to spin down with a rate similar in magnitude to the previous spin up rate . 
 the spin period has changed from @xmath0110  s to @xmath0160  s within the last three decades .

"we investigate the location of the radio jet bases ( `` radio cores '' ) of blazars in radio images , and their stationarity by means of dense very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations . in order to measure the position of a radio core

 this angular scale corresponds to the de - projected length of a scale of @xmath0 schwarzschild radii ( @xmath1 ) at the distance of markarian  421 .

 the temperature dependence of the quasielastic line width @xmath4 can be explained with an orbach  process , i.e. a relaxation via the coupling between crystal field excitations and phonons . at low temperatures 
 the nd4f magnetic response @xmath5 correlates with the electronic properties of the @xmath6layers . in the insulator @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) the quasielastic line vanishes below 80  k and an inelastic

 the abrupt change of @xmath2 can be exploited to switch properties specific to the overlayer material . 
 this is demonstrated for the example of the superconducting critical temperature of a vanadium film which we predict to jump by 20% at a discontinuity of @xmath2 ."

 the method uses the line of sight magnetic field on the photosphere as observational input . 
 the value of @xmath0 is determined iteratively by comparing the reconstructed magnetic field with the observed structures .

"multivariate associated kernel estimators , which depend on both target point and bandwidth matrix , are appropriate for partially or totally bounded distributions and generalize the classical ones as gaussian . 
 previous studies on multivariate associated kernels have been restricted to product of univariate associated kernels , also considered having diagonal bandwidth matrices .

 are introduced . 
 properties of these estimators are presented ; in particular , the boundary bias is investigated . 
 then , the generalized bivariate beta kernels are handled with more details . 
 the associated kernel with a correlation structure is built with a variant of the mode - dispersion method and two families of bandwidth matrices are discussed under the criterion of cross - validation .

"dynamical friction arises from the interaction of a perturber and the gravitational wake it excites in the ambient medium . this interaction is usually derived assuming that the perturber has a constant velocity . in realistic situations , 
 motion is accelerated as for instance by dynamical friction itself . here , we study the effect of acceleration on the dynamical friction force . 
 we characterize the density enhancement associated with a constantly accelerating perturber with rectilinear motion in an infinite homogeneous gaseous medium and show that dynamical friction is not a local force and that its amplitude may depend on the perturber s initial velocity . 
 the force on an accelerating perturber is maximal between mach 1 and mach 2 , where it is smaller than the corresponding uniform motion friction . in the limit where the perturber s size is much smaller than the distance needed to change the mach number by unity through acceleration , a subsonic perturber feels a force similar to uniform motion friction only if its past history does not include supersonic episodes . 
 once an accelerating perturber reaches large supersonic speeds , accelerated motion friction is marginally stronger than uniform motion friction . 
 the force on a decelerating supersonic perturber is weaker than uniform motion friction as the velocity decreases to a few times the sound speed . 
 dynamical friction on a decelerating subsonic perturber with an initial mach number larger than 2 is much larger than uniform motion friction and tends to a finite value as the velocity vanishes in contrast to uniform motion friction .

"the calculation of a segment of eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors of a hermitian matrix or matrix pencil has many applications . 
 a new density - matrix - based algorithm has been proposed recently and a software package feast has been developed . 
 the density - matrix approach allows feast s implementation to exploit a key strength of modern computer architectures , namely , multiple levels of parallelism . 
 consequently , the software package has been well received , especially in the electronic structure community . 
 nevertheless , theoretical analysis of feast has lagged . 
 for instance , the feast algorithm has not been proven to converge . 
 this paper offers a detailed numerical analysis of feast . 
 in particular , we show that the feast algorithm can be understood as an accelerated subspace iteration algorithm in conjunction with the rayleigh - ritz procedure . 
 the novelty of feast lies in its accelerator which is a rational matrix function that approximates the spectral projector onto the eigenspace in question . 
 analysis of the numerical nature of this approximate spectral projector and the resulting subspaces generated in the feast algorithm establishes the algorithm s convergence . 
 this paper shows that feast is resilient against rounding errors and establishes properties that can be leveraged to enhance the algorithm s robustness .

"if a gravitational microlensing event is caused by a widely separated binary lens and the source approaches both lens components , the source flux is successively magnified by the individual lenses : double microlensing events . if events are observed astrometrically , double lensing events are expected to occur with an increased frequency due to the long range astrometric effect of the companion . 
 we find that although the trajectory of the source star image centroid shifts of an astrometric double lensing event has a distorted shape from both of the elliptical ones induced by the individual single lens components , event duplication can be readily identified by the characteristic loop in the trajectory formed during the source s passage close to the companion . 
 we determine and compare the probabilities of detecting double lensing events from both photometric and astrometric lensing observations by deriving analytic expressions for the relations between binary lensing parameters to become double lensing events . from this determination 
 , we find that for a given set of the binary separation and the mass ratio the astrometric probability is roughly an order higher than the photometric probability . 
 therefore , we predict that a significant fraction of events that will be followed up by using future high precision interferometeric instruments will be identified as double lensing events ."
"* gibbs - ringing is a well known artifact which manifests itself as spurious oscillations in the vicinity of sharp image transients , e.g. at tissue boundaries .

 this difference is possibly an outcome of the fact that blue galaxies have a more filamentary distribution . comparing the sf galaxies with only the blue other galaxies , we find that the two show nearly equal filamentarity . separately analyzing the galaxies with high star formation rates ( sfr ) and low sfr , we find that the latter has a more filamentary distribution . 
 we interpret this in terms of two effects ( 1 . ) 
 a correlation between the sfr and individual galaxy properties like luminosity with the high sfr galaxies being more luminous ( 2 . ) a relation between the sfr and environmental effects like the density with the high sfr galaxies preferentially occurring in high density regions . 
 these two effects are possibly not independent and are operating simultaneously . 
 we do not find any difference in the filamentarity of sf galaxies and agns .

"we investigate the statistical evolution of magnetic neutron stars recycled in low mass binary ( lmb ) systems , simulating synthetic populations . 
 irrespective to the details of the physical models , we find to be significant the fraction of neutron stars spinning close to their mass shedding limit relative to the millisecond pulsar population . 
 the simulated neutron stars show a tail in their period distribution at periods shorter than 1.558 ms , the minimum detected so far . 
 crustal magnetic field decay models predict also the existence of massive rapidly spinning neutron stars with very low magnetic moment .

"the results of speckle interferometric observations at the soar telescope in 2014 are given . 
 a total of 1641 observations were taken , yielding 1636 measurements of 1218 resolved binary and multiple stars and 577 non - resolutions of 441 targets . 
 we resolved for the first time 56 pairs , including some nearby astrometric or spectroscopic binaries and ten new subsystems in previously known visual binaries . 
 the calibration of the data is checked by linear fits to the positions of 41 wide binaries observed at soar over several seasons . 
 the typical calibration accuracy is 01 in angle and 0.3% in pixel scale , while the measurement errors are on the order of 3mas .

"we positionally match sources observed by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , and the faint images of the radio sky at twenty - cm ( first ) survey . 
 practically all 2mass sources are matched to an sdss source within 2 arcsec ; @xmath011% of them are optically resolved galaxies and the rest are dominated by stars . 
 about 1/3 of first sources are matched to an sdss source within 2 arcsec ; @xmath080% of these are galaxies and the rest are dominated by quasars .

"we investigate percolation in binary and ternary mixtures of patchy colloidal particles theoretically and using monte carlo simulations . 
 each particle has three identical patches , with distinct species having different types of patch . 
 theoretically we assume tree - like clusters and calculate the bonding probabilities using wertheim s first - order perturbation theory for association . for ternary mixtures we find up to eight fundamentally different percolated states . 
 the states differ in terms of the species and pairs of species that have percolated . 
 the strongest gel is a trigel or tricontinuous gel , in which each of the three species has percolated . 
 the weakest gel is a mixed gel in which all of the particles have percolated , but none of the species percolates by itself . 
 the competition between entropy of mixing and internal energy of bonding determines the stability of each state . 
 theoretical and simulation results are in very good agreement . 
 the only significant difference is the temperature at the percolation threshold , which is overestimated by the theory due to the absence of closed loops in the theoretical description ."
"we investigate the dynamics and afterglow light curves of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) blast waves that encounter various density structures ( such as bumps , voids , or steps ) in the surrounding ambient medium . 
 we present and explain the characteristic response features that each type of density structures in the medium leaves on the forward shock ( fs ) and reverse shock ( rs ) dynamics , for blast waves with either a long - lived or short - lived rs . 
 we show that , when the ambient medium density drops , the blast waves exhibit in some cases a period of an actual acceleration ( even during their deceleration stage ) , due to adiabatic cooling of blast waves . comparing numerical examples that have different shapes of bumps or voids , 
 we propose a number of consistency tests that correct modeling of blast waves needs to satisfy . 
 our model results successfully pass these tests . employing a lagrangian description of blast waves 
 , we perform a sophisticated calculation of afterglow emission . 
 we show that , as a response to density structures in the ambient medium , the rs light curves produce more significant variations than the fs light curves . some observed features ( such as re - brightenings , dips , or slow wiggles ) 
 can be more easily explained within the rs model . 
 we also discuss on the origin of these different features imprinted on the fs and rs light curves ."
"the exact formulation of multi - configuration density - functional theory ( dft ) is discussed in this work . as an alternative to range - separated methods , where electron correlation effects are split in the coordinate space , the combination of configuration interaction methods with orbital occupation functionals 
 is explored at the formal level through the separation of correlation effects in the orbital space . when applied to model hamiltonians

 an adiabatic connection expression is derived for the complementary bath functional and a comparison with density matrix embedding theory ( dmet ) is made . 
 illustrative results are given for the simple two - site hubbard model . 
 soet is then applied to a quantum chemical hamiltonian , thus leading to an exact complete active space site - occupation functional theory ( cassoft ) where active electrons are correlated explicitly within the cas and the remaining contributions to the correlation energy are described with an orbital occupation functional .

"we present 21 cm hi line observations of 5@xmath01 square degrees centered on the local abell cluster 1367 obtained as part of the arecibo galaxy environment survey . 
 one hundred sources are detected ( 79 new hi measurements and 50 new redshifts ) , more than half belonging to the cluster core and its infalling region . combining the hi data with sdss optical imaging we show that our hi selected sample follows scaling relations similar to the ones usually observed in optically selected samples . 
 interestingly all galaxies in our sample appear to have nearly the same baryon fraction independently of their size , surface brightness and luminosity . 
 the most striking difference between hi and optically selected samples resides in their large scale distribution : whereas optical and x - ray observations trace the cluster core very well , in hi there is almost no evidence of the presence of the cluster . 
 some implications on the determination of the cluster luminosity function and hi distribution for samples selected at different wavelength are also discussed .

"magnetic electric effects in ferromagnetic metals are discussed from the viewpoint of effective spin electromagnetic field that couples to conduction electron spin . 
 the effective field in the adiabatic limit is the spin berry s phase in space and time , and it leads to spin motive force ( voltage generated by magnetization dynamics ) and topological hall effect due to spin chirality . its gauge coupling to spin current describes the spin transfer effect , where magnetization structure is driven by an applied spin current . 
 the idea of effective gauge field can be extended to include spin relaxation and rashba spin - orbit interaction . 
 voltage generation by the inverse edelstein effect in junctions is interpreted as due to the electric component of rashba - induced spin gauge field . 
 the spin gauge field arising from the rashba interaction turns out to coincides with troidal moment , and causes asymmetric light propagation ( directional dichroism ) as a result of the doppler shift .

 one - dimensional sints can be prepared by proper assembly of hydrogenated cage - like silicon clusters to form semiconductors with a large band gap , and their electronic properties can be accurately tuned by transition metal doping in the center of the tubes . specifically , doping with fe made the sints metallic and magnetic materials . 
 more interestingly , a metal to half - metal transition was observed with increasing tube radius in fe - doped sints , which demonstrates that sints doped with magnetic elements may find important applications in spintronics .

"it is straightforward to determine the size of the earth and the distance to the moon without making use of a telescope . 
 the methods have been known since the 3rd century bc . 
 however , few amateur or professional astronomers have worked this out from data they themselves have taken . 
 here we use a _ gnomon _ to determine the latitude and longitude of south bend , indiana , and college station , texas , and determine a value of the radius of the earth of 6290 km , only 1.4 percent smaller than the true value . 
 we use the method of aristarchus and the size of the earth s shadow during the lunar eclipse of 2011 june 15 to derive an estimate of the distance to the moon ( 62.3 r@xmath0 ) , some 3.3 percent greater than the true mean value . 
 we use measurements of the angular motion of the moon against the background stars over the course of two nights , using a simple cross staff device , to estimate the moon s distance at perigee and apogee . 
 finally , we use simultaneous ccd observations of asteroid 1996 hw1 obtained with small telescopes in socorro , new mexico , and ojai , california , to derive a value of the astronomical unit of ( 1.59 @xmath1 0.19 ) @xmath2 10@xmath3 km , about 6 percent too large .

 we do not find a dramatic order of magnitude increase in the number of observed independent modes in zz  ceti stars , traversing from the hot to the cool edge of the instability strip ; we find that the cool davs have one more mode on average compared to the hot davs . 
 we confirm the initial increase in pulsation amplitude at the blue edge , and find strong evidence of a decline in amplitude prior to the red edge .

"_ counterfactual regret minimization _ ( cfr ) is the most popular iterative algorithm for solving zero - sum imperfect - information games . _ 
 regret - based pruning _ ( rbp ) is an improvement that allows poorly - performing actions to be temporarily pruned , thus speeding up cfr . 
 we introduce _ total rbp _ , a new form of rbp that reduces the space requirements of cfr as actions are pruned . 
 we prove that in zero - sum games it asymptotically prunes any action that is not part of a best response to some nash equilibrium . 
 this leads to provably faster convergence and lower space requirements . 
 experiments show that total rbp results in an order of magnitude reduction in space , and the reduction factor increases with game size ."

 such an anisotropy might be partially tested by two - three string detection at @xmath9 . 
 a cpt violation may induce a more remarkable suppression of vertical up - going tracks because of larger @xmath2 reduction for @xmath10 ."

"the neutrinos detected from the next galactic core - collapse supernova will contain valuable information on the internal dynamics of the explosion . 
 one mechanism leading to a temporal evolution of the neutrino signal is the variation of the induced neutrino flavor mixing driven by changes in the density profile . with one and two dimensional hydrodynamical simulations we identify the behavior and properties of prominent features of the explosion . 
 using these results we demonstrate the time variation of the neutrino crossing probabilities due to changes in the msw neutrino transformations as the star explodes by using the s - matrix - monte carlo - approach to neutrino propagation . after adopting spectra for the neutrinos emitted from the proto - neutron star we calculate for a galactic supernova 
 the evolution of the positron spectra within a water cerenkov detector and the ratio of charged current to neutral current event rates for a heavy water - sno like - detector and find that these detector signals are feasible probes of a number of explosion features ."
"a model for synchronization of globally coupled phase oscillators including `` inertial '' effects is analyzed . 
 in such a model , both oscillator frequencies and phases evolve in time . 
 stationary solutions include incoherent ( unsynchronized ) and synchronized states of the oscillator population . assuming a lorentzian distribution of oscillator natural frequencies , @xmath0 , both larger inertia or larger frequency spread stabilize the incoherent solution , thereby making harder to synchronize the population . in the limiting case @xmath1 , the critical coupling becomes independent of inertia . 
 a richer phenomenology is found for bimodal distributions . 
 for instance , inertial effects may destabilize incoherence , giving rise to bifurcating synchronized standing wave states . 
 inertia tends to harden the bifurcation from incoherence to synchronized states : at zero inertia , this bifurcation is supercritical ( soft ) , but it tends to become subcritical ( hard ) as inertia increases . 
 nonlinear stability is investigated in the limit of high natural frequencies ."

 we also show that for a specific range of control parameters , the model exhibits the phenomenon of fermi acceleration .

 the carina dcs obey a well - defined period - luminosity relation , allowing us to readily distinguish between overtone and fundamental pulsators in nearly every case . 
 unlike rr  lyr stars , the pulsation mode turns out to be uncorrelated with light - curve shape , nor do the overtone pulsators tend towards shorter periods compared to the fundamental pulsators . using the period - luminosity ( pl ) relations from nemec et al .

 the error reflects the uncertainties in the dc distance scale , and in the metallicity and reddening of carina . 
 the frequency of dcs among upper main sequence stars in carina is approximately 3% . 
 the ratio of dwarf cepheids to rr  lyr stars in carina is 0.13 @xmath5 0.10 , though this result is highly sensitive to the star - formation history of carina and the evolution of the horizontal branch .

"-.3 true in this paper uses the caustic crossing events in the microlens data sets to explore the nature and location of the lenses . 
 we conclude that the large majority of lenses , whether they are luminous or dark , are likely to be binaries . 
 further , we demonstrate that blending is an important feature of all the data sets . 
 an additional interpretation suggested by the data , that the caustic crossing events along the directions to the magellanic clouds are due to lenses located in the clouds , implies that most of the lmc / smc events to date are due to lenses in the magellanic clouds . 
 all of these conclusions can be tested . 
 if they are correct , a large fraction of lenses along the direction to the lmc may be ordinary stellar binary systems , just as are the majority of the lenses along the direction to the bulge . 
 thus , a better understanding of the larger - than - anticipated value derived for the bulge optical depth may allow us to better interpret the large value derived for the optical depth to the lmc . 
 indeed , binarity and blending in the data sets may illuminate connections among several other puzzles : the dearth of binary - source s , the dearth of non - caustic - crossing perturbed binary - lens s , and the dearth of obviously blended point - lens s.    # 1(#1 )    -.8 true in    -0.4 true in -0.3 true in"

"in this paper , we introduce the counterterms that remove the non - logarithmic divergences of the action in third order lovelock gravity for static spacetimes . 
 we do this by defining the cosmological constant in such a way that the asymptotic form of the metric have the same form in lovelock and einstein gravities . 
 thus , we employ the counterterms of einstein gravity and show that the power law divergences of the action of lovelock gravity for static spacetimes can be removed by suitable choice of coefficients . 
 we find that the dependence of these coefficients on the dimension in lovelock gravity is the same as in einstein gravity . 
 we also introduce the finite energy - momentum tensor and employ these counterterms to calculate the finite action and mass of static black hole solutions of third order lovelock gravity . 
 next , we calculate the thermodynamic quantities and show that the entropy calculated through the use of gibbs - duhem relation is consistent with the obtained entropy by wald s formula . 
 furthermore , we find that in contrast to einstein gravity in which there exists no uncharged extreme black hole , third order lovelock gravity can have these kind of black holes . 
 finally , we investigate the stability of static charged black holes of lovelock gravity in canonical ensemble and find that small black holes show a phase transition between very small and small black holes , while the large ones are stable ."

"we present a computational scheme for extracting the energy level alignment of a metal / molecule interface , based on constrained density functional theory and local exchange and correlation functionals . 
 the method , applied here to benzene on li(100 ) , allows us to evaluate charge transfer energies , as well as the spatial distribution of the image charge induced on the metal surface . 
 we systematically study the energies for charge transfer from the molecule to the substrate as function of the molecule - substrate distance , and investigate the effects arising from image charge confinement and local charge neutrality violation . for benzene on li(100 ) we find that the image charge plane is located at about 1.8    above the li surface , and that our calculated charge transfer energies compare perfectly with those obtained with a classical electrostatic model having the image plane located at the same position . 
 the methodology outlined here can be applied to study any metal / organic interface in the weak coupling limit at the computational cost of a total energy calculation .

"we present a set of cluster models that link the present - day properties of clusters to the processes that govern galaxy formation . 
 these models treat the entropy distribution of the intracluster medium as its most fundamental property . because convection strives to establish an entropy gradient that rises with radius , the observable properties of a relaxed cluster depend entirely on its dark - matter potential and the entropy distribution of its uncondensed gas . 
 guided by simulations , we compute the intracluster entropy distribution that arises in the absence of radiative cooling and supernova heating by assuming that the gas - density distribution would be identical to that of the dark matter . 
 the lowest - entropy gas would then fall below a critical entropy threshold at which the cooling time equals a hubble time . 
 radiative cooling and whatever feedback is associated with it must modify the entropy of that low - entropy gas , changing the overall entropy distribution function and thereby altering the observable properties of the cluster . using some phenomenological prescriptions for entropy modification based on the existence of this cooling threshold , we construct a remarkably realistic set of cluster models . 
 the surface - brightness profiles , mass - temperature relation , and luminosity - temperature relation of observed clusters all naturally emerge from these models . by introducing a single adjustable parameter related to the amount of intracluster gas that can cool within a hubble time 
 , we can also reproduce the observed temperature gradients of clusters and the deviations of cooling - flow clusters from the standard luminosity - temperature relation ."
"the potentials between static sources in various representations in @xmath0 are calculated based on the fat - center - vortices model of faber , greensite and olejnk . at intermediate distances , 
 most distributions of the flux within vortices lead to potentials that are qualitatively in agreement with `` casimir scaling , '' which says that the string tension is proportional to the quadratic operator of the representation . 
 however , at the quantitative level , violations of casimir scaling are generally much larger than those seen in numerical simulations , indicating that additional physical input to the fat - center - vortices model is required . at large distances 
 , screening occurs for zero - triality representations ; for the representations with non - zero triality the string tension equals that of the fundamental representation .

"in practical ultra - wideband ( uwb ) systems , rake receivers are not able to fully take advantage of all resolvable paths , because of the required computational and power resources . on the other hand , 
 transmitted reference ( tr ) schemes are simple , robust structures with low power consumption and they do not require channel estimation , but they sustain a 3db energy / rate loss , as each symbol requires the transmission of two pulses . alternatively , the differential tr ( dtr ) scheme offers 3db performance gain compared to conventional tr structures and double data rates since the previously transmitted data pulse is used as a reference . in this paper 
 we introduce a less complex , energy - efficient tr scheme , called self reference ( sr ) uwb system , which uses as reference an elaborated replica of the received signal .

 our results suggest that above the ` fri / frii ' radio luminosity break most of the radio sources are associated with objects that have excess mid - ir emission , only some of which are broad - line objects , although there is one clear low - accretion - rate fri . 
 the fraction of objects with mid - ir excess drops dramatically below the fri / frii break , although there exists at least one high - accretion - rate qso .

"a significant fraction ( @xmath030% ) of the high - energy gamma - ray sources listed in the second _ fermi _  lat catalog ( 2fgl ) are still of unknown origin , being not yet associated with counterparts at low energies . 
 we recently developed a new association method to identify if there is a @xmath1-ray blazar candidate within the positional uncertainty region of a generic 2fgl source . 
 this method is entirely based on the discovery that blazars have distinct infrared colors with respect to other extragalactic sources found thanks , to the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( _ wise _ ) all - sky observations . 
 several improvements have been also performed to increase the efficiency of our method in recognizing @xmath1-ray blazar candidates . in this paper

 the success of the pep - ii and kekb asymmetric colliders @xcite in producing unprecedented luminosity above 10@xmath4 @xmath2s@xmath3 has taught us about the accelerator physics of asymmetric @xmath0 colliders in a new parameter regime .

"icecube have observed neutrinos which are presumably of extra - galactic origin . since specific sources have not yet been identified , we discuss what could be learned from the conceptual point of view . 
 we use a simple model for neutrino production from the interactions between nuclei and matter , and we focus on the description of the spectral shape and flavor composition observed by icecube . 
 our main parameters are spectral index , maximal energy , magnetic field , and composition of the accelerated nuclei . 
 we show that a cutoff at pev energies can be achieved by soft enough spectra , a cutoff of the primary energy , or strong enough magnetic fields . 
 these options , however , are difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that these neutrinos originate from the same sources as the ultra - high energy cosmic rays . we demonstrate that heavier nuclei accelerated in the sources may be a possible way out if the maximal energy scales appropriately with the mass number of the nuclei . in this scenario , 
 neutrino observations can actually be used to test the uhecr acceleration mechanism . 
 we also emphasize the need for a volume upgrade of the icecube detector for future precision physics , for which the flavor information becomes a statistical meaningful model discriminator as qualitatively new ingredient ."

 the versatile framework of compressed sensing naturally applies for solving the corresponding inverse problem .

 an electrode with small hole is used as a mask to shield the photocathode from the accelerating vacuum chamber . 
 using such a masked photocathode will make the replacement of photocathode material easy by rotating the photocathode behind the electrode into the hole . 
 furthermore , this helps reduce the dark current or secondary electron emission from the photocathode material . 
 the masked photocathode also provides transverse cut - off to a gaussian laser beam that reduces electron beam emittance growth from nonlinear space - charge effects ."
"we present an analytic derivation of the temporal dependence of the perpendicular transport coefficient of charged particles in magnetostatic turbulence , for times smaller than the time needed to charged particles to travel the turbulence correlation length . 
 this time window is left unexplored in most transport models . in our analysis 
 all magnetic scales are taken to be much larger than the particle gyroradius , so that perpendicular transport is assumed to be dominated by the guiding center motion . 
 particle drift from the local magnetic field lines and magnetic field lines random walk are evaluated separately for slab and 3d isotropic turbulence . 
 contributions of wavelength scales shorter and longer than the turbulence coherence length are compared . 
 in contrast to slab case , particles in 3d isotropic turbulence unexpectedly diffuse from local magnetic field lines ; this result questions the common assumption that particle magnetization is independent on turbulence geometry . extensions of this model will allow for a study of solar wind anisotropies ."
"in this work we propose schemes for joint model - order and step - size adaptation of reduced - rank adaptive filters . 
 the proposed schemes employ reduced - rank adaptive filters in parallel operating with different orders and step sizes , which are exploited by convex combination strategies . the reduced - rank adaptive filters used in the proposed schemes are based on a joint and iterative decimation and interpolation ( jidf ) method recently proposed . 
 the unique feature of the jidf method is that it can substantially reduce the number of coefficients for adaptation , thereby making feasible the use of multiple reduced - rank filters in parallel . 
 we investigate the performance of the proposed schemes in an interference suppression application for cdma systems .

 we find , by comparing the ` regular ' and ` sideways ' potentials , that tadpole improvement results in very little renormalization of the bare anisotropy and reduces the discretization errors in the static quark potential and in the glueball masses ."
"we introduce a new matrix function for studying graphs and real - world networks based on a double - factorial penalization of walks between nodes in a graph .

 we derive a communicability function , a subgraph centrality and a double - factorial estrada index based on this new matrix function . 
 we obtain upper and lower bounds for the double - factorial estrada index of graphs , showing that they are similar to those of the single - factorial estrada index . 
 we then compare these indices with the single - factorial one for simple graphs and real - world networks . 
 in particular , we study the problem of identification of essential proteins in yeast . 
 we conclude that for this practical problem the structural information contained in the longer walks on graphs is not as relevant as the one contained in the shorter ones for characterizing network structure . 
 more practical applications of the new indices are needed to extract more definitive conclusions on their use for analyzing complex networks .

"given a locally consistent set of reduced density matrices , we construct approximate density matrices which are globally consistent with the local density matrices we started from when the trial density matrix has a tree structure . 
 we employ the cavity method of statistical physics to find the optimal density matrix representation by slowly decreasing the temperature in an annealing algorithm , or by minimizing an approximate bethe free energy depending on the reduced density matrices and some cavity messages originated from the bethe approximation of the entropy . 
 we obtain the classical bethe expression for the entropy within a naive ( mean - field ) approximation of the cavity messages , which is expected to work well at high temperatures . in the next order of the approximation

 we investigate the perturbations exerted by a gas ring on a nearly - keplerian stellar disk orbiting a smbh by means of combined direct n - body and smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations . 
 we simulate the formation of gas rings through the infall and disruption of a molecular gas cloud , adopting different inclinations between the infalling gas cloud and the stellar disk .

"while the idea of using the operator product expansion ( ope ) to extract the strong coupling from hadronic @xmath0 decay data is not new , there is an ongoing controversy over how to include quark - hadron `` duality violations '' ( _ i.e. _ , resonance effects ) which are not described by the ope . 
 one approach attempts to suppress duality violations enough that they might become negligible , but pays the price of an uncontrolled ope truncation . 
 we critically examine a recent analysis using this approach and show that it fails to properly account for non - perturbative effects , making the resulting determination of the strong coupling unreliable . in a different approach duality violations are taken into account with a model , avoiding the ope truncation . 
 this second approach provides a self - consistent determination of the strong coupling from @xmath0 decays ."

"we present a theory which can explain the micromaser as well as its optical counterpart , the microlaser , for appropriate values of dissipative parameters . 
 we show that , in both the the cases , the cavity radiation fields can have sub - poissonian photon statistics . 
 we further analyse if it is possible to attain a fock state of the radiation field . 
 the microlaser is precluded for such analysics due to the damping of its lasing levels making transitions at optical frequencies . 
 hence , we focus our attention on the micromaser and our exact simulation of the dynamics shows that it is not possible to generate a fock state of the cavity radiation field .    2"
"the damping of a massless fermion coupled to a massless scalar particle at finite temperature is considered using the braaten - pisarski resummation technique . 
 first the hard thermal loop diagrams of this theory are extracted and effective green s functions are constructed . using these effective green s functions the damping rate of a soft yukawa fermion 
 is calculated . 
 this rate provides the most simple example for the damping of a soft particle . to leading order 
 it is proportional to @xmath0 , whereas the one of a hard fermion is of higher order ."
"_ abstract _ : interest in the protein folding problem has motivated a wide range of theoretical and experimental studies of the kinetics of the collapse of flexible homopolymers . in this paper 
 a phenomenological model is proposed for the kinetics of the early stages of homopolymer collapse following a quench from temperatures above to below the @xmath0 temperature . in the first stage , 
 nascent droplets of the dense phase are formed , with little effect on the configurations of the bridges that join them . 
 the droplets then grow by accreting monomers from the bridges , thus causing the bridges to stretch . during these two stages 
 the overall dimensions of the chain decrease only weakly . further growth of the droplets is accomplished by the shortening of the bridges , which causes the shrinking of the overall dimensions of the chain . 
 the characteristic times of the three stages respectively scale as @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the degree of polymerization of the chain .

"@xmath0-body simulations have unveiled several apparently universal properties of dark matter halos , including a cusped density profile , a power - law pseudo phase - space density @xmath1 , and a linear @xmath2 relation between the density slope and the velocity anisotropy .

"we demonstrate how a quantum otto engine ( qoe ) can be implemented using a single ion and an always - on thermal environment

 the coupling to the hot and the cold baths need not be switched off and on in an alternative fashion during the engine cycle , unlike other existing proposals of qoe .

"white dwarfs are the end product of the lifes of intermediate- and low - mass stars and their evolution is described as a simple cooling process . 
 recently , it has been possible to determine with an unprecedented precision their luminosity function , that is , the number of stars per unit volume and luminosity interval . 
 we show here that the shape of the bright branch of this function is only sensitive to the averaged cooling rate of white dwarfs and we propose to use this property to check the possible existence of axions , a proposed but not yet detected weakly interacting particle . 
 our results indicate that the inclusion of the emission of axions in the evolutionary models of white dwarfs noticeably improves the agreement between the theoretical calculations and the observational white dwarf luminosity function . 
 the best fit is obtained for @xmath0  mev , where @xmath1 is the mass of the axion and @xmath2 is a free parameter . 
 we also show that values larger than 10 mev are clearly excluded . 
 the existing theoretical and observational uncertainties do not yet allow the confirmation of the existence of axions , but our results clearly show that if their mass is of the order of few mev , the white dwarf luminosity function is sensitive enough to detect their existence ."

"we experiment with injecting a continuous stream of gas into a shallow liquid , similar to how one might blow into a straw placed at the bottom of a near - empty drink . by varying the angle of the straw ( here a metal needle ) 
 , we observe a variety of dynamics , which we film using a high - speed camera . 
 most noteworthy is an intermediate regime in which cyclical jets erupt from the air - liquid interface and breakup into air - born droplets . 
 these droplets trace out a parabolic trajectory and bounce on the air - liquid interface before eventually coalescing . 
 the shape of each jet , as well as the time between jets , is remarkably similar and leads to droplets with nearly identical trajectories .

"the form factor of a quantum graph is a function measuring correlations within the spectrum of the graph . 
 it can be expressed as a double sum over the periodic orbits on the graph . 
 we propose a scheme which allows one to evaluate the periodic orbit sum for a special family of graphs and thus to recover the expression for the form factor predicted by the random matrix theory . 
 the scheme , although producing the expected answer , undercounts orbits of a certain structure , raising doubts about an analogous summation recently proposed for quantum billiards ."
"estimates of velocities from time series of photospheric and/or chromospheric vector magnetograms can be used to determine fluxes of magnetic energy ( the poynting flux ) and helicity across the magnetogram layer , and to provide time - dependent boundary conditions for data - driven simulations of the solar atmosphere above this layer . 
 velocity components perpendicular to the magnetic field are necessary both to compute these transport rates and to derive model boundary conditions . here 
 , we discuss some possible approaches to estimating perpendicular flows from magnetograms . 
 since doppler shifts contain contributions from flows parallel to the magnetic field , perpendicular velocities are not generally recoverable from doppler shifts alone . 
 the induction equation s vertical component relates evolution in @xmath0 to the perpendicular flow field , but has a finite null space , meaning some `` null '' flows , e.g. , motions along contours of normal field , do not affect @xmath0 . 
 consequently , additional information is required to accurately specify the perpendicular flow field . 
 tracking methods , which analyze @xmath1 in a neighborhood , have a long heritage , but other approaches have recently been developed . in a recent paper 
 , several such techniques were tested using synthetic magnetograms from mhd simulations . here 
 , we use the same test data to characterize : 1 ) the ability of the induction equation s normal component , by itself , to estimate flows ; and 2 ) a tracking method s ability to recover flow components that are perpendicular to @xmath2 and parallel to contours of @xmath0 .

"the so - called `` early activity '' of comet 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko has been observed to originate mostly in parts of the concave region or `` neck '' between its two lobes . 
 since activity is driven by the sublimation of volatiles , this is a puzzling result because this area is less exposed to the sun and is therefore expected to be cooler on average @xcite . 
 we used a thermophysical model that takes into account thermal inertia , global self - heating , and shadowing , to compute surface temperatures of the comet . 
 we found that , for every rotation in the august 
 december 2014 period , some parts of the neck region undergo the fastest temperature variations of the comet s surface precisely because they are shadowed by their surrounding terrains . 
 our work suggests that these fast temperature changes are correlated to the early activity of the comet , and we put forward the hypothesis that erosion related to thermal cracking is operating at a high rate on the neck region due to these rapid temperature variations . 
 this may explain why the neck contains some ice as opposed to most other parts of the surface @xcite and why it is the main source of the comet s early activity @xcite .    in a broader context , 
 these results indicate that thermal cracking can operate faster on atmosphereless bodies with significant concavities than implied by currently available estimates @xcite ."
"we report a 3d magnetohydrodynamics simulation that studies the formation of dipolarization fronts during magnetotail reconnection . 
 the crucial new feature uncovered in the present 3d simulation is that the process of reconnection produces flux ropes developing within the reconnection region . 
 these flux ropes are unstable to the kink mode and introduce a spontaneous structure in the dawn - dusk direction . 
 the dipolarization fronts forming downstream of reconnection are strongly affected by the kinking ropes . at the fronts , 
 a density gradient is present with opposite direction to that of the acceleration field and leads to an interchange instability . 
 we present evidence for a causal link where the perturbations of the kinking flux ropes with their natural and well defined scales drive and select the scales for the interchange mode in the dipolarization fronts . 
 the results of the simulation are validated against measured structures observed by the themis mission ."
"we have proposed a qualitative model for the structure of binary systems similar to pd  er alloys , which explains their nonmonotonic relaxation after the hydrogen saturation . 
 it is based on the assumption that such a solid solution involves two kind heterogeneities . 
 the former are caused by spinodal decomposition of the initially homogeneous state of the solid solution into the phases enriched and depleted of er atoms . 
 the latter are crystalline defects that trap an additional amount of er atoms , which leads also to their local accumulation , changing the defect properties . 
 hydrogen atoms penetrating into the solid disturb the equilibrium of both the phase separation and the defect saturation with er atoms , causing redistribution of er atoms . 
 the diffusion fluxes give rise to the motion of the interface between the two phases that is responsible for time variations , for example , in the relative volume of the enriched phase observed experimentally . 
 we have found the conditions when the interface motion can change the direction during the system relaxation to a new equilibrium state . 
 the latter effect is , from our point of view , the essence of the hydrogen induced nonmonotonic relaxation observed in such systems . 
 the numerical simulation confirms the basic assumptions ."

"the total entropy production generated by the dynamics of an externally driven systems exchanging energy and matter with multiple reservoirs and described by a master equation is expressed as the sum of three contributions , each corresponding to a distinct mechanism for bringing the system out of equilibrium : nonequilibrium initial conditions , external driving , and breaking of detailed balance . 
 we derive three integral fluctuation theorems ( fts ) for these contributions and show that they lead to the following universal inequality : an arbitrary nonequilibrium transformation always produces a change in the total entropy production greater or equal than the one produced if the transformation is done very slowly ( adiabatically ) . 
 previously derived fluctuation theorems can be recovered as special cases . 
 we show how these fts can be experimentally tested by performing the counting statistics of the electrons crossing a single level quantum dot coupled to two reservoirs with externally varying chemical potentials .

"the model of dna torsion dynamics supports soliton solutions , which are supposed to be of special interest for dna transcription . in the discussion of the model , 
 one usually adopts the approximation @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a parameter related to the equilibrium distance between bases in a watson - crick pair . here

 the mc results on the overall ph ratio , the ph ratio at the surface and in the bulk as well as the number of adsorbed monomers are in quantitative agreement with this hypothesis and the theoretically derived @xmath0 .

"we introduce a semi - classical wavefunction ( scwf ) model for strong - field physics and attosecond science . when applied to high harmonic generation ( hhg ) , this formalism allows one to show that the natural time - domain separation of the contribution of ionization , propagation and recollisions to the hhg process leads to a frequency - domain factorization of the harmonic yield into these same contributions , for any choice of atomic or molecular potential . 
 we first derive the factorization from the natural expression of the dipole signal in the temporal domain by using a reference system , as in the quantitative rescattering ( qrs ) formalism [ j.  phys . 
 b.  * 43 * , 122001 ( 2010 ) ] . 
 alternatively , we show how the trajectory component of the scwf can be used to express the factorization , which also allows one to attribute individual contributions to the spectrum to the underlying trajectories ."
"it is shown that one can obtain quantitatively accurate values for the superconducting critical temperature within a hamiltonian framework . 
 this is possible if one uses a renormalized hamiltonian that contains an attractive electron

 it can be obtained by similarity renormalization or using flow equations for hamiltonians . 
 we calculate the critical temperature as a function of the coupling using the standard bcs  theory . for small coupling 
 we rederive the mcmillan formula for @xmath0 .

"in this note , we reconcile two approaches that have been used to construct stringy multiplications . 
 the pushing forward after pulling back that has been used to give a global stringy extension of the functors @xmath0@xcite , and the pulling back after having pushed forward , which we have previously used in our ( re)-construction program for @xmath1frobenius algebras , notably in considerations of singularities with symmetries and for symmetric products . 
 a similar approach was also used by @xcite in their considerations of the chen 
 ruan product in a derham setting for abelian orbifolds . 
 we show that the pull  push formalism has a solution by the push 
 pull equations in two situations . 
 the first is a derham formalism with thom push  forward maps and the second is the setting of cyclic twisted sectors , which was at the heart of the ( re)-construction program . 
 we go on to do formal calculations using fractional euler classes which allows us to formally treat all the stringy multiplications mentioned above in the general setting . 
 the upshot is the formal trivialization of the co  cycles of the reconstruction program using the presentation of the obstruction bundle of @xcite ."
"motivated by the insb nanowire superconductor system , we investigate a system where one - dimensional topological superconductors are placed in parallel .

 we analytically determine the topological phase diagram by explicitly calculating the topological number and the band structure . 
 they show even - odd effects with respect to the number of legs of the ladder . 
 when the relative phase between the inter- and intrachain superconducting pairings is 0 or @xmath0 , the system belongs to the class bdi characterized by the @xmath1 index , and otherwise it belongs to the class d characterized by the @xmath2 index . 
 this topological class change would be caused by applying the josephson current or an external magnetic field , and could be observed by measuring the zero - bias differential conductance ."

"hypervelocity stars have been recently discovered in the outskirts of galaxies , such as the unbound star in the milky way halo , or the three anomalously fast intracluster planetary nebulae ( icpne ) in the virgo cluster . 
 these may have been ejected by close 3-body interactions with a binary supermassive black hole ( smbbh ) , where a star which passes within the semimajor axis of the smbbh can receive enough energy to eject it from the system . 
 stars ejected by smbbhs may form a significant sub - population with very different kinematics and mean metallicity than the bulk of the intracluster stars . 
 the number , kinematics , and orientation of the ejected stars may constrain the mass ratio , semimajor axis , and even the orbital plane of the smbbh . 
 we investigate the evolution of the ejected debris from a smbbh within a clumpy and time - dependent cluster potential using a high resolution , self - consistent cosmological n - body simulation of a galaxy cluster .

"in the mapping of the local ism it is of some interest to know where the first indications of the boundary of the local bubble can be measured . 
 the hipparcos distances combined to @xmath0 photometry and some sort of spectral classification permit mapping of the spatial extinction distribution .

 are given but a luminosity class is often missing . 
 the @xmath0 photometry and the parallax do , however , permit a dwarf / giant separation due to the value of the slope of the reddening vector compared to the gradient of the main sequence in a color magnitude diagram , in the form : @xmath0 @xmath2 @xmath3 = @xmath4 , together with the rather shallow extinction present in the hipparcos sample .

"we consider the problem of a robot learning the mechanical properties of objects through physical interaction with the object , and introduce a practical , data - efficient approach for identifying the motion models of these objects . 
 the proposed method utilizes a physics engine , where the robot seeks to identify the inertial and friction parameters of the object by simulating its motion under different values of the parameters and identifying those that result in a simulation which matches the observed real motions . 
 the problem is solved in a bayesian optimization framework . 
 the same framework is used for both identifying the model of an object online and searching for a policy that would minimize a given cost function according to the identified model . 
 experimental results both in simulation and using a real robot indicate that the proposed method outperforms state - of - the - art model - free reinforcement learning approaches ."

 we find that the effect of @xmath0 and @xmath1 acceptance on the ratio of the susceptibilities are small relative to their dependence on the beam energy or the charged states of the used particles . 
 we also present a hrg based calculation for various combinations of cumulant ratios of protons and pions , recently proposed as robust observables ( with no theoretical uncertainties ) for critical point search in the experiments . these results which increase as a function of collision energy will provide a better baseline for non - critical point physics compared to poisson expectation ."

"by using the drone - fermion representation and the schwinger - keldysh approach , we calculate the current noise and the charge noise for a single - electron transistor in the non - equilibrium state in the presence of large quantum fluctuation of island charge .

"protecting quantum correlation from decoherence is one of the crucial issues in quantum information processing . 
 it has been commonly recognized that any initial quantum correlation of a composite system diminishes asymptotically or abruptly to zero under local markovian decoherence . here 
 we show that , contrary to this recognition , a noticeable gaussian quantum discord of a continuous - variable bipartite system can be frozen in the steady state in the non - markovian dynamics if each of the subsystems forms a localized mode with its local reservoir . 
 the condition for this frozen quantum discord can be reached by appropriately engineering the structure of the reservoirs .

 , the network undergoes avalanching breakdowns to a fragmented state from which it never recovers . 
 this breakdown is much less violent if the growth is by random rather than preferential attachment ( as defines the barabsi and albert model ) .

 no breakdown avalanches occur .

"we investigate structure and kinematics of the second generation of stars ( sg ) formed from gaseous ejecta of the first generation of stars ( fg ) in forming globular clusters ( gcs ) . 
 we consider that sg can be formed from gaseous ejecta from agb stars of fg with the initial total mass of @xmath0 to explain the present masses of the galactic gcs . 
 our 3d hydrodynamical simulations with star formation show that sg formed in the central regions of fg can have a significant amount of rotation ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) . 
 the rotational amplitude of sg can depend strongly on the initial kinematics of fg . 
 we thus propose that some gcs composed of fg and sg had a significant amount of rotation when they were formed . 
 we also suggest that although later long - term ( @xmath3 gyr ) dynamical evolution of stars can smooth out the initial structural and kinematical differences between fg and sg to a large extent , initial flattened structures and rotational kinematics of sg can be imprinted on shapes and internal rotation of the present gcs . 
 we discuss these results in terms of internal rotation observed in the galactic gcs ."

"we prove that every computably enumerable ( c.e . )

 our proof , which is simpler than the standard one , can also be used for the original theorem . 
 our positive result can be contrasted with the case of computable functions , where not every computable function is provably computable in pa , or even more interestingly , with the fact that almost all random finite strings are not provably random in pa . 
 we also prove two negative results : a ) there exists a universal machine whose universality can not be proved in pa , b ) there exists a universal machine @xmath0 such that , based on @xmath0 , pa can not prove the randomness of its halting probability .

"we study the effects that ripples induce on the electrical and magnetic properties of graphene . 
 the variation of the interatomic distance created by the ripples translates in a modulation of the hopping parameter between carbon atoms . 
 a tight binding hamiltonian including a hubbard interaction term is solved self consistently for ripples with different amplitudes and periods . 
 we find that , for values of the hubbard interaction @xmath0 above a critical value @xmath1 , the system displays a superposition of local ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ordered states . 
 nonetheless the global ferromagnetic order parameter is zero . 
 the @xmath1 depends only on the product of the period and hopping amplitude modulation . 
 when the hubbard interaction is close to the critical value of the antiferromagnetic transition in pristine graphene , the antiferromagnetic order parameter becomes much larger than the ferromagnetic one , being the ground state similar to that of flat graphene ."
"the purpose of the present study is to compare the predictions of different models of star formation rate ( sfr ) history in the universe with the upper limit of super kamiokande for the neutrino background . to this aim

 different from previous studies we have used the @xmath0cdm model with @xmath1 . 
 we have assumed that the detector used for the detection the neutrino flux is superk and also we have assumed that the electron neutrinos produced in the supernovae oscillate equally to the three standard model flavors . by these assumptions 
 all models stay below the upper limit of superk on the event rate and the detection of the supernova relic neutrino background ( srnb ) remains undetected . 
 future neutrino detectors such as km3net will be able to detect the srnb and distinguish between the models of the sfr history ."
"we combine the  extended source catalogue and the 2df galaxy redshift survey to produce an infrared - selected galaxy catalogue with measured redshifts .

 these parameters are derived assuming a cosmological model with @xmath7 and @xmath8 . with datasets of this size , 
 systematic rather than random errors are the dominant source of uncertainty in the determination of the luminosity function . 
 we carry out a careful investigation of possible systematic effects in our data . 
 the surface brightness distribution of the sample shows no evidence that significant numbers of low surface brightness or compact galaxies are missed by the survey . 
 we estimate the present - day distributions of @xmath9  and j@xmath9  colours as a function of absolute magnitude and use models of the galaxy stellar populations , constrained by the observed optical and infrared colours , to infer the galaxy stellar mass function . 
 integrated over all galaxy masses , this yields a total mass fraction in stars ( in units of the critical mass density ) of @xmath10 for a kennicutt imf and @xmath11 for a salpeter imf . 
 these values are consistent with those inferred from observational estimates of the total star formation history of the universe provided that dust extinction corrections are modest .

"this paper describes a model for nonlinear acoustic wave propagation through absorbing and weakly dispersive media , and its numerical solution by means of finite differences in time domain method ( fdtd ) . 
 the attenuation is based on multiple relaxation processes , and provides frequency dependent absorption and dispersion without using computational expensive convolutional operators . in this way , by using an optimization algorithm the coefficients for the relaxation processes can be obtained in order to fit a frequency power law that agrees the experimentally measured attenuation data for heterogeneous media over the typical frequency range for ultrasound medical applications . 
 our results show that two relaxation processes are enough to fit attenuation data for most soft tissues in this frequency range including the fundamental and the first ten harmonics . 
 furthermore , this model can fit experimental attenuation data that do not follow exactly a frequency power law over the frequency range of interest . 
 the main advantage of the proposed method is that only one auxiliary field per relaxation process is needed , which implies less computational resources compared with time - domain fractional derivatives solvers based on convolutional operators ."

"we carry out ray tracing through five high resolution simulations of a galaxy cluster to study how its ability to produce giant gravitationally lensed arcs is influenced by the collision cross - section of its dark matter . in three cases typical dark matter particles in the cluster core 
 undergo between 1 and 100 collisions per hubble time ; two more explore the long ( `` collisionless '' ) and short ( `` fluid '' ) mean free path limits . 
 we study the size and shape distributions of arcs and compute the cross - section for producing `` extreme '' arcs of various sizes . 
 even a few collisions per particle modify the core structure enough to destroy the cluster s ability to produce long , thin arcs . for larger collision frequencies the cluster must be scaled up to unrealistically large masses before it regains the ability to produce giant arcs . 
 none of our models with self - interacting dark matter ( except the `` fluid '' limit ) is able to produce radial arcs ; even the case with the smallest scattering cross - section must be scaled to the upper limit of observed cluster masses before it produces radial arcs . 
 apparently the elastic collision cross - section of dark matter in clusters must be very small , below 0.1 @xmath0g@xmath1 , to be compatible with the observed ability of clusters to produce both radial arcs and giant arcs .

"we study in detail the quasinormal modes of linear gravitational perturbations of plane - symmetric anti - de sitter black holes . 
 the wave equations are obtained by means of the newman - penrose formalism and the chandrasekhar transformation theory . 
 we show that oscillatory modes decay exponentially with time such that these black holes are stable against gravitational perturbations . 
 our numerical results show that in the large ( small ) black hole regime the frequencies of the ordinary quasinormal modes are proportional to the horizon radius @xmath0 ( wave number @xmath1 ) . 
 the frequency of the purely damped mode is very close to the algebraically special frequency in the small horizon limit , and goes as @xmath2 in the opposite limit . 
 this result is confirmed by an analytical method based on the power series expansion of the frequency in terms of the horizon radius . 
 the same procedure applied to the schwarzschild anti - de sitter spacetime proves that the purely damped frequency goes as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the quantum number characterizing the angular distribution . finally , we study the limit of high overtones and find that the frequencies become evenly spaced in this regime . 
 the spacing of the frequency per unit horizon radius seems to be a universal quantity , in the sense that it is independent of the wave number , perturbation parity and black hole size ."

 considering the baseline configuration of the european xfel in hamburg , and based on beam dynamics simulations , we demonstrate here that the usage of corrugated structures allows for a considerable increase in radiation bandwidth .

"the upper limit on the energy density of a stochastic gravitational wave ( gw ) background obtained from the two - year science run ( s5 ) of the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) is used to constrain the average gw production of core collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) .

 we scale the generic source spectrum to obtain an observation - based upper limit on the average gw emission . 
 we show that the mean energy emitted in gws can be constrained within @xmath1 depending on the average source spectrum . while these results are higher than the total available gravitational energy in a core collapse event , second and third generation gw detectors will enable tighter constraints to be set on the gw emission from such systems ."
"electron beam induced current ( ebic ) is a powerful characterization technique which offers the high spatial resolution needed to study polycrystalline solar cells . 
 current models of ebic assume that excitations in the @xmath0-@xmath1 junction depletion region result in perfect charge collection efficiency . 
 however we find that in cdte and si samples prepared by focused ion beam ( fib ) milling , there is a reduced and nonuniform ebic lineshape for excitations in the depletion region . 
 motivated by this , we present a model of the ebic response for excitations in the depletion region which includes the effects of surface recombination from both charge - neutral and charged surfaces . for neutral surfaces we present a simple analytical formula which describes the numerical data well , while the charged surface response depends qualitatively on the location of the surface fermi level relative to the bulk fermi level .

"diffuse emission in the mid - infrared shows a wealth of structure , that lends itself to high - resolution structure analysis of the interstellar gas . a large part of the emission comes from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , excited by nearby ultra - violet sources . can the observed diffuse emission structure be interpreted as column density structure ? 
 we discuss this question with the help of a set of model molecular clouds bathed in the radiation field of a nearby o - star . 
 the correlation strength between column density and `` observed '' flux density strongly depends on the absolute volume density range in the region . 
 shadowing and irradiation effects may completely alter the appearance of an object . 
 irradiation introduces additional small - scale structure and it can generate structures resembling shells around hii - regions in objects that do not possess any shell - like structures whatsoever . 
 nevertheless , structural information about the underlying interstellar medium can be retrieved . in the more diffuse regime ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) 
 , flux density maps may be used to trace the 3d density structure of the cloud via density gradients . 
 thus , while caution definitely is in order , mid - infrared surveys such as glimpse will provide quantitative insight into the turbulent structure of the interstellar medium ."
"the superconducting ( sc ) high intensity and energy ( hie ) isolde linac will replace most of the existing accelerating infrastructure of the radioactive ion beam experiment ( rex ) at cern , however , the 101.28 mhz rfq and 5 mv ih cavity will remain in the role of injector for the upgrade , boosting the beam up to an energy of 1.2 mev / u . 
 we present the results of a beam dynamics investigation of the injector focused most critically on matching the longitudinal beam parameters from the rfq to the sc machine , which is complicated largely by the ih cavity employing a combined zero degree ( konus ) beam dynamics design ,  @xcite . 
 the longitudinal beam parameters at the rfq are reconstructed from measurement using the three gradient method and combined with beam dynamics measurements and simulations of the ih structure to design the matching section for the sc linac ."
"an attempt at understanding the downward overshooting in the convective envelopes of the post - main - sequence stars has been made on the basis of three - dimensional large eddy simulations , using artificially modified opal opacity and taking into account radiation and ionization in the equation of state . 
 two types of stars , an intermediate mass star and a massive star were considered . to avoid the long thermal relaxation time of the intermediate mass star 
 , we increased the stellar energy flux artificially while trying to maintain a structure close to the one given by one - dimensional stellar model . 
 a parametric study of the flux factor was performed . for the massive star , 
 no such manner was necessary . 
 numerical results were analyzed when the system reached the statistical steady state . 
 it was shown that the penetration distance in pressure scale heights is of the order of unit . 
 the scaling relations among the penetration distance , input flux and vertical velocity fluctuations studied by singh et al . 
 ( 1998 ) were checked . 
 the anisotropy of the turbulent convection and the diffusion models of third order moments representing the non - local transports were also investigated . 
 these models are dramatically affected by the velocity fields and no universal constant parameters seem to exist .

"and to a direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of the navier - stokes equations . 
 we derive the krmn - howarth equation for both the clark@xmath0 and leray@xmath0 models . 
 we confirm one of two possible scalings resulting from this equation for clark@xmath0 as well as its associated @xmath1 energy spectrum . 
 clark@xmath0 reproduces the large - scale energy spectrum and intermittency properties of the dns . for the leray@xmath0 model , 
 increasing the filter width , @xmath2 , decreases the nonlinearity and , hence , the effective reynolds number is substantially decreased . 
 therefore even for the smallest value of @xmath2 studied leray@xmath0 was inadequate as a sgs model . 
 the lans@xmath0 energy spectrum @xmath3 , consistent with its so - called `` rigid bodies , '' precludes a reproduction of the large - scale energy spectrum of the dns . 
 we find , however , that this same feature reduces its intermittency compared to clark@xmath0 ( which shares a similar krmn - howarth equation ) . 
 clark@xmath0 is found to be the best approximation for reproducing the total dissipation rate and the energy spectrum at scales larger than @xmath2 , whereas high - order intermittency properties for larger values of @xmath2 are best reproduced by lans@xmath0 ."

"real - time monitoring and responses to emerging public health threats rely on the availability of timely surveillance data . during the early stages of an epidemic , the ready availability of _ line lists _ with detailed tabular information about laboratory - confirmed cases can assist epidemiologists in making reliable inferences and forecasts . 
 such inferences are crucial to understand the epidemiology of a specific disease early enough to stop or control the outbreak 
 . however , construction of such line lists requires considerable human supervision and therefore , difficult to generate in real - time . in this paper 
 , we motivate * guided deep list * , the first tool for building automated line lists ( in near real - time ) from open source reports of emerging disease outbreaks . specifically , we focus on deriving epidemiological characteristics of an emerging disease and the affected population from reports of illness . * 
 guided deep list * uses distributed vector representations ( ala word2vec ) to discover a set of indicators for each line list feature . 
 this discovery of indicators is followed by the use of dependency parsing based techniques for final extraction in tabular form . 
 we evaluate the performance of * guided deep list * against a human annotated line list provided by healthmap corresponding to mers outbreaks in saudi arabia . 
 we demonstrate that * guided deep list * extracts line list features with increased accuracy compared to a baseline method . 
 we further show how these automatically extracted line list features can be used for making epidemiological inferences , such as inferring demographics and symptoms - to - hospitalization period of affected individuals ."

 both deterministic and stochastic models can be proposed to describe such a problem . 
 we exploit a previously derived mathematical relationship between these models to derive a general method for analyzing the invasion fitness of stochastic models .

"the parity - non - conserving ( pnc ) asymmetry in @xmath0 at thermal energies has recently been calculated using effective field - theory methods . a comparison of this calculation with much more elaborate calculations performed in the 70 s is made . 
 this allows one to assess the validity of this new approach as presently used . 
 it is found to overshoot the almost exact calculations by a factor close to 2 for the contribution involving the @xmath1 component of both the initial and final states . 
 this is much larger than anticipated by the authors . 
 this discrepancy is analyzed and found to originate from the over - simplified description of the deuteron and capture states which underlies the new approach . 
 the claim that earlier determinations of the sign would be in error is also examined . 
 it is found that the sign discrepancy is most probably due , instead , to the fact that the pion - nucleon interaction referred to by the authors corresponds to a parity - non - conserving potential with a sign opposite to what is currently used .

"multipartite quantum correlations are important resources for the development of quantum information and computation protocols . 
 however , the resourcefulness of multipartite quantum correlations in practical settings is limited by its fragility under decoherence due to environmental interactions . though there exist protocols to protect bipartite entanglement under decoherence , the implementation of such protocols for multipartite quantum correlations has not been sufficiently explored . here , we study the effect of local amplitude damping channel on the generalized greenberger - horne - zeilinger state , and use a protocol of optimal reversal quantum weak measurement to protect the multipartite quantum correlations . 
 we observe that the weak measurement reversal protocol enhances the robustness of multipartite quantum correlations . 
 further it increases the critical damping value that corresponds to entanglement sudden death . to emphasize the efficacy of the technique in protection of multipartite quantum correlation , we investigate two proximately related quantum communication tasks , namely , quantum teleportation in a one sender , many receivers setting and multiparty quantum information splitting , through a local amplitude damping channel .

"we discuss the fragmentation of primordial gas clouds in the universe after decoupling . comparing the time scale of collapse with that of fragmentation

"we present new pre - maximum and late - time optical photometry of the type  ia / iin supernova 2002ic . 
 these observations are combined with the published v - band magnitudes of  @xcite and the vlt spectrophotometry of  @xcite to construct the most extensive light curve to date of this unusual supernova . 
 the observed flux at late time is significantly higher relative to the flux at maximum than that of any other observed type  ia supernova and continues to fade very slowly a year after explosion . 
 our analysis of the light curve suggests that a non - type ia supernova component becomes prominent @xmath0  days after explosion . 
 modeling of the non - type ia supernova component as heating from the shock interaction of the supernova ejecta with pre - existing circumstellar material suggests the presence of a @xmath1  cm gap or trough between the progenitor system and the surrounding circumstellar material . 
 this gap could be due to significantly lower mass - loss @xmath2  years prior to explosion or evacuation of the circumstellar material by a low - density fast wind . 
 the latter is consistent with observed properties of proto - planetary nebulae and with models of white - dwarf + asymptotic giant branch star progenitor systems with the asymptotic giant branch star in the proto - planetary nebula phase ."
"the theory of polar magnetic burial in accreting neutron stars predicts that a mountain of accreted material accumulates at the magnetic poles of the star , and that , as the mountain spreads equatorward , it is confined by , and compresses , the equatorial magnetic field . 
 here , we extend previous , axisymmetric , grad - shafranov calculations of the hydromagnetic structure of a magnetic mountain up to accreted masses as high as @xmath0 , by importing the output from previous calculations ( which were limited by numerical problems and the formation of closed bubbles to @xmath1 ) into the time - dependent , ideal - magnetohydrodynamic code zeus-3d and loading additional mass onto the star dynamically . 
 the rise of buoyant magnetic bubbles through the accreted layer is observed in these experiments .

 surprisingly , it is observed that the equilibria are marginally stable for all @xmath2 ; the mountain oscillates persistently when perturbed , in a combination of alfvn and acoustic modes , without appreciable damping or growth , and is therefore not disrupted ( apart from a transient parker instability initially , which expels @xmath3 of the mass and magnetic flux ) .

"we consider a minimal classically scale - invariant extension of the standard model . in this theory , 
 the higgs mechanism is triggered and the electroweak symmetry breaking is generated radiatively by the coleman - weinberg sector which is coupled to the sm higgs . 
 we extend the higgs portal interactions of the theory to include an additional singlet which is also non - minimally coupled to gravity . 
 this generates a single - field slow - roll inflation mechanism in the effective field theory formulation which is robust up to planck scales . 
 our approach does not require integrating in any additional new physics degrees of freedom to unitarise the theory in the sub - planckian regime where inflation happens . as a result 
 , no large threshold corrections appear in our approach to inflation so that the electroweak scale and the sm higgs mass are not affected . 
 the singlet field responsible for inflation also gives a viable dark matter candidate in our model .

"single linear polymer chains in dilute solutions under good solvent conditions are studied by monte carlo simulations with the pruned - enriched rosenbluth method up to the chain length @xmath0 . 
 based on the standard simple cubic lattice model ( sclm ) with fixed bond length and the bond fluctuation model ( bfm ) with bond lengths in a range between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we investigate the conformations of polymer chains described by self - avoiding walks ( saws ) on the simple cubic lattice , and by random walks ( rws ) and non - reversible random walks ( nrrws ) in the absence of excluded volume ( ev ) interactions . 
 in addition to flexible chains , we also extend our study to semiflexible chains for different stiffness controlled by a bending potential . 
 the persistence lengths of chains extracted from the orientational correlations are estimated for all cases . 
 we show that chains based on the bfm are more flexible than those based on the sclm for a fixed bending energy . 
 the microscopic differences between these two lattice models are discussed and the theoretical predictions of scaling laws given in the literature are checked and verified . 
 our simulations clarify that a different mapping ratio between the coarse - grained models and the atomistically realistic description of polymers is required in a coarse - graining approach due to the different crossovers to the asymptotic behavior ."

"we investigate multi - field inflationary scenarios with fields that drop out of the model in a staggered fashion . 
 this feature is natural in certain multi - field inflationary setups within string theory ; for instance , it can manifest itself when fields are related to tachyons that condense , or inter - brane distances that become meaningless when branes annihilate . considering a separable potential , and promoting the number of fields to a smooth time - dependent function 
 , we derive the formalism to deal with these models at the background and perturbed level , providing general expressions for the scalar spectral index and the running . 
 we recover known results of e.g. a dynamically relaxing cosmological constant in the appropriate limits . 
 we further show that isocurvature perturbations are suppressed during inflation , so that perturbations are adiabatic and nearly gaussian . 
 the resulting setup might be interpreted as a novel type of warm inflation , readily implemented within string theory and without many of the shortcomings associated with warm inflation .    to exemplify the applicability of the formalism we consider three concrete models : assisted inflation with exponential potentials as a simple toy model ( a graceful exit becomes possible ) , inflation from multiple tachyons ( a constant decay rate of the number of fields and negligible slow roll contributions turns out to be in good agreement with observations ) and inflation from multiple m5-branes within m - theory ( a narrow stacking of branes yields a consistent scenario ) ."

"we discuss the interpretation of transient , unpulsed radio emission detected from the unique pulsar / be - star binary system psr b1259@xmath063 . 
 extensive monitoring of the 1994 and 1997 periastron passages has shown that the source flares over a 100-day interval around periastron , varying on time - scales as short as a day and peaking at 60 mjy ( @xmath1 times the apastron flux density ) at 1.4 ghz . interpreting the emission as synchrotron radiation 
 , we show that ( i ) the observed variations in flux density are too large to be caused by the shock interaction between the pulsar wind and an isotropic , radiatively driven , be - star wind , and ( ii ) the radio emitting electrons do not originate from the pulsar wind . 
 we argue instead that the radio electrons originate from the circumstellar disk of the be star and are accelerated at two epochs , one before and one after periastron , when the pulsar passes through the disk . 
 a simple model incorporating two epochs of impulsive acceleration followed by synchrotron cooling reproduces the essential features of the radio light curve and spectrum and is consistent with the system geometry inferred from pulsed radio data .

"we investigate the formation process of planetesimals from the dust layer by the gravitational instability in the gas disk using local @xmath0-body simulations . 
 the gas is modeled as a background laminar flow . 
 we study the formation process of planetesimals and its dependence on the strength of the gas drag . 
 our simulation results show that the formation process is divided into three stages qualitatively : the formation of wake - like density structures , the creation of planetesimal seeds , and their collisional growth . 
 the linear analysis of the dissipative gravitational instability shows that the dust layer is secularly unstable although toomre s @xmath1 value is larger than unity . 
 however , in the initial stage , the growth time of the gravitational instability is longer than that of the dust sedimentation and the decrease in the velocity dispersion . thus , the velocity dispersion decreases and the disk shrinks vertically . as the velocity dispersion becomes sufficiently small , the gravitational instability finally becomes dominant . then wake - like density structures are formed by the gravitational instability . 
 these structures fragment into planetesimal seeds . 
 the seeds grow rapidly owing to mutual collisions ."
"solar prominences are long - lived cool and dense plasma curtains in the hot and rarefied outer solar atmosphere or corona . 
 the physical mechanism responsible for their formation and especially for their internal plasma circulation has been uncertain for decades . 
 the observed ubiquitous down flows in quiescent prominences are difficult to interpret as plasma with high conductivity seems to move across horizontal magnetic field lines . 
 here we present three - dimensional numerical simulations of prominence formation and evolution in an elongated magnetic flux rope as a result of in - situ plasma condensations fueled by continuous plasma evaporation from the solar chromosphere . 
 the prominence is born and maintained in a fragmented , highly dynamic state with continuous reappearance of multiple blobs and thread structures that move mainly downward dragging along mass - loaded field lines . 
 the prominence plasma circulation is characterized by the dynamic balance between the drainage of prominence plasma back to the chromosphere and the formation of prominence plasma via continuous condensation . 
 plasma evaporates from the chromosphere , condenses into the prominence in the corona , and drains back to the chromosphere , establishing a stable chromosphere - corona plasma cycle . 
 synthetic images of the modeled prominence with the solar dynamics observatory atmospheric imaging assembly closely resemble actual observations , with many dynamical threads underlying an elliptical coronal cavity ."

 the spm and not data show periods of 42mins and 64mins respectively , but with much weaker amplitudes , 2.6mags and 1.3mmags respectively . 
 these modulations arise from either x - ray irradiation of the inner face of the secondary star and/or a superhump modulation from the accretion disc , or quasi - periodic modulations in the accretion disc . 
 it is unclear whether these periods / quasi - periodic modulations are related to the orbital period , however , the strongest period of 51.3mins is close to earlier tentative orbital periods . 
 further observations taken over a long base - line are encouraged ."
"one of the most discussed peculiarities of einstein s theory of relativity is the twin paradox , the fact that the time between two events in space - time appears to depend on the path between these events . 
 we show that this time discrepancy results only from faulty assumptions in the transition from one reference system to another 
 . the twin paradox does not exist . 
 but the lorentz invariance of the theory has strong consequences , if we assume that it is valid not only locally , but also on cosmic scale ."
"we generalize the kinetic theory of fluids , in which the description of fluids is based on the geodesic motion of particles , to spacetimes modeled by finsler geometry . 
 our results show that finsler spacetimes are a suitable background for fluid dynamics and that the equation of motion for a collisionless fluid is given by the liouville equation , as it is also the case for a metric background geometry . 
 we finally apply this model to collisionless dust and a general fluid with cosmological symmetry and derive the corresponding equations of motion . 
 it turns out that the equation of motion for a dust fluid is a simple generalization of the well - known euler equations ."

"the expansion of an initially unmagnetized planar rarefaction wave has recently been shown to trigger a thermal anisotropy - driven weibel instability ( tawi ) , which can generate magnetic fields from noise levels . 
 it is examined here if the tawi can also grow in a curved rarefaction wave . 
 the expansion of an initially unmagnetized circular plasma cloud , which consists of protons and hot electrons , into a vacuum is modelled for this purpose with a two - dimensional particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulation . 
 it is shown that the momentum transfer from the electrons to the radially accelerating protons can indeed trigger a tawi . 
 radial current channels form and the aperiodic growth of a magnetowave is observed , which has a magnetic field that is oriented orthogonal to the simulation plane . 
 the induced electric field implies that the electron density gradient is no longer parallel to the electric field . 
 evidence is presented here for that this electric field modification triggers a second magnetic instability , which results in a rotational low - frequency magnetowave . 
 the relevance of the tawi is discussed for the growth of small - scale magnetic fields in astrophysical environments , which are needed to explain the electromagnetic emissions by astrophysical jets . 
 it is outlined how this instability could be examined experimentally ."

 we find that for magnetic fields @xmath4 g , the dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the field is weak , and they can be approximated by the bulk viscosity for zero magnetic field . for fields @xmath5 g , the dependence of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the field is strong , and they exhibit de haas - van alphen - type oscillations . with increasing magnetic field , the amplitude of these oscillations increases , which eventually leads to negative @xmath0 in some regions of parameter space . 
 we show that the change of sign of @xmath0 signals a hydrodynamic instability . as an application 
 , we discuss the effects of the new bulk viscosities on the r - mode instability in rotating strange quark stars . 
 we find that the instability region in strange quark stars is affected when the magnetic fields exceeds the value @xmath6 g. for fields which are larger by an order of magnitude , the instability region is significantly enlarged , making magnetized strange stars more susceptible to @xmath7-mode instability than their unmagnetized counterparts ."

"in this paper , the behavior of a spherical hole in an otherwise infinite and uniform universe is investigated . 
 first , the newtonian theory is developed . 
 the concept of negative gravity , an outward gravitational force acting away from the center of the spherical hole , is presented , and the resulting expansion of the hole is investigated . then , the same result is derived using the techniques of einstein s theory of general relativity . 
 the field equations are solved for an infinite uniform universe and then for an infinite universe in which matter is uniformly distributed except for a spherical hole . 
 negative pressure caused by negative gravity is utilized . 
 the physical significance of the cosmological constant is explained , and a new physical concept , that of the gravitational potential of a hole , is discussed . the relationship between the newtonian potential for a hole and the schwarzschild solution of the field equations 
 is explored . 
 finally , the geodesic equations are considered . 
 it is shown that photons and particles are deflected away from the hole . 
 an application of this idea is pursued , in which a new cosmology based upon expanding holes in a uniform universe is developed . 
 the microwave background radiation and hubble s law , among others , are explained .

"we reconsider a number of measurements for the overall hydration kinetics of tricalcium silicate pastes having an initial water to cement weight ratio close to @xmath0 .

 twisted graphene bilayer and the surface state of topological crystalline insulator are the representative materials which show low - energy saddle points that are feasible to probe by gating . 
 we approximate the fermi surface near saddle point with a hyperbola and calculate the static lindhard response function . employing a theorem of lighthill , the induced charge density @xmath0 due to an impurity is obtained and the algebraic decay of @xmath0 is determined by the singularity of the static response function . although a hyperbolic fermi surface is rather different from a circular one , the static lindhard response function in the present case shows a singularity similar with the response function associated with circular fermi surface , which leads to the @xmath1 at large distance @xmath2 . 
 the dependences of charge density on the fermi energy are different .

"sharp chemical discontinuities can occur in protoplanetary discs , particularly at ` snow - lines ' where a gas - phase species freezes out to form ice grains .

"in the perturbative approach , substructures in the lens can be reduced to their effect on the two perturbative fields @xmath0 and @xmath1 . 
 a simple generic model of elliptical lens with a substructure situated near the critical radius is investigated in details . 
 analytical expressions are derived for each perturbative field , and basic properties are analyzed . 
 the power spectrum of the fields is well approximated by a power - law , resulting in significant tails at high frequencies . 
 another feature of the perturbation by a substructure is that the ratio of the power spectrum at order @xmath2 of the 2 fields @xmath3 is nearly 1 . 
 the ratio @xmath4 is specific to substructures , for instance an higher order distortion ( @xmath5 ) but with auto - similar isophotes will result in @xmath6 . 
 finally , the problem of reconstructing the perturbative field is investigated . local field model 
 are implemented and fitted to maximize image similarity in the source plane . 
 the non - linear optimization is greatly facilitated , since in the perturbative approach the circular source solution is always known . 
 examples of images distortions in the subcritical regime due to substructures are presented , and analyzed for different source shapes . 
 provided enough images and signal is available , the substructure field can be identified confidently . 
 these results suggests that the perturbative method is an efficient tool to estimate the contribution of substructures to the mass distribution of lenses .

 we find models with kurucz atmospheres which have indeed a cut - off frequency beyond the largest observed frequency and which are well within the   @xmath4 error box . for hd24712 only models which are hotter by about 100k and less luminous by nearly 10% than what is actually the most probable value would have an  large enough . 
 one may thus speculate that the old controversy about a mismatch between observed largest frequencies and theoretical cut - off frequencies of roap star models is resolved . however , the observational errors for the astrophysical fundamental parameters have to be reduced further and the model atmospheres refined .

"the two - state model of stochastic resonance is extended to a chain of coupled two - state elements governed by the dynamics of glauber s stochastic ising model . 
 appropriate assumptions on the model parameters turn the chain into a prototype system of coupled stochastic resonators . in a weak - signal limit 
 analytical expressions are derived for the spectral power amplification and the signal - to - noise ratio of a two - state element embedded into the chain . 
 the effect of the coupling between the elements on both quantities is analysed and array - enhanced stochastic resonance is established for pure as well as noisy periodic signals . 
 the coupling - induced improvement of the snr compared to an uncoupled element is shown to be limited by a factor four which is only reached for vanishing input noise ."
"the huge and increasing demand of data connectivity motivates the development of new and effective power line communication ( plc ) channel models , which are able to faithfully describe a real communication scenario . 
 this is of fundamental importance since a good model represents a quick evaluation tool for new standards or devices , allowing a considerable saving in time and costs . 
 the aim of this paper is to discuss a novel top - down mimo plc synthetic channel model , able to numerically emulate a real plc environment . 
 first , the most common channel modeling strategies are briefly described , highlighting strengths and weaknesses . 
 afterwards , the basic model approach is described considering the siso scenario . 
 the implementation strategy is then extended to the mimo case . 
 the validity of the proposed model is proved making a comparison between the simulated channels and channels obtained with measurements in terms of both performance and statistical metrics . 
 the focus is on the broadband frequency spectrum .

"using a lagrangian mechanics approach , we construct a framework to study the dissipative properties of systems composed of two components one of which is highly lossy and the other is lossless . 
 we have shown in our previous work that for such a composite system the modes split into two distinct classes , high - loss and low - loss , according to their dissipative behavior . 
 a principal result of this paper is that for any such dissipative lagrangian system , with losses accounted by a rayleigh dissipative function , a rather universal phenomenon occurs , namely , _ selective overdamping _ : 
 the high - loss modes are all overdamped , i.e. , non - oscillatory , as are an equal number of low - loss modes , but the rest of the low - loss modes remain oscillatory each with an extremely high quality factor that actually increases as the loss of the lossy component increases . 
 we prove this result using a new time dynamical characterization of overdamping in terms of a virial theorem for dissipative systems and the breaking of an equipartition of energy ."

 the overall shape of the spectra is consistent with the predictions of the two - arm spiral shock model wherein the gas found in the 40  to 50  range has been accelerated by some 20  from its rotation curve velocity . 
 spin temperatures of @xmath0100 k are derived for the local arm gas , lower than found in a previous , similar study towards dr 7 . for the interarm region ,

"recently i proposed a simple dynamical network model for discrete space - time which self - organizes as a graph with hausdorff dimension @xmath0 . 
 the model has a geometric quantum phase transition with disorder parameter @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the spectral dimension of the dynamical graph . 
 self - organization in this network model is based on a competition between a ferromagnetic ising model for vertices and an antiferromagnetic ising model for edges . in this paper 
 i solve a toy version of this model defined on a bipartite graph in the mean field approximation . 
 i show that the geometric phase transition corresponds exactly to the antiferromagnetic transition for edges , the dimensional disorder parameter of the former being mapped to the staggered magnetization order parameter of the latter . 
 the model has a critical point with long - range correlations between edges , where a continuum random geometry can be defined , exactly as in kazakov s famed 2d random lattice ising model but now in any number of dimensions ."
"we use simulations of star clusters to investigate the possible dynamical origins of the observed spread in core radius among intermediate - age and old star clusters in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) . 
 two effects are considered , a time - varying external tidal field and variations in primordial hard binary fraction . 
 simulations of clusters orbiting a point - mass galaxy show similar core radius evolution for clusters on both circular and elliptical orbits and we therefore conclude that the tidal field of the lmc has not yet significantly influenced the evolution of the intermediate - age clusters . 
 the presence of large numbers of hard primordial binaries in a cluster leads to core radius expansion ; however , the magnitude of the effect is insufficient to explain the observations . 
 further , the range of binary fractions required to produce significant core radius growth is inconsistent with the observational evidence that all the lmc clusters have similar stellar luminosity functions .

"edge reconstruction modifies the electronic properties of finite graphene samples . we formulate a low - energy theory of the reconstructed zigzag edge by deriving the modified boundary condition to the dirac equation .

"we investigate the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida oscillations of the itinerant carrier spin density in a system where those oscillations appear only due to a finite distribution of a localized spin . 
 the system represents a half - infinite one - dimensional quantum wire with a magnetic impurity located at its edge . 
 in contrast to the conventional model of a point - like exchange interaction the itinerant carrier spin density oscillations in this system exist . 
 we _ analytically _ demonstrate that when the radius of the exchange interaction is less than the wave length of the itinerant carriers living on the fermi surface , the long range behavior of the oscillations is identical to the one taking place in the zero radius limit of the same exchange interaction but for an infinite one - dimensional quantum wire where , in comparison with the original half - infinite system , the mass of the itinerant carriers is _ strongly _ modified by the exchange interaction radius . on the basis of our analysis 
 we make a suggestion on directionality of surface ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida interaction shown in recent experiments : we believe that in general the anisotropy of the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida interaction could result not only from the anisotropy of the _ fermi surface _ of itinerant carriers but also from the anisotropy of the _ spin carrying atomic orbitals _ of magnetic impurities ."

"a two - step measurement protocol of a quantum system , known as _ weak value _ ( wv ) , has been introduced more than two decades ago by aharonov _

 we discuss another two - step measurement protocol which we dub _

 the protocol consists of a partial - collapse measurement followed by quantum manipulation on the system and finally a strong measurement . 
 the first step is a strong measurement which takes place with small probability . 
 the second strong measurement is used as postselection on the outcome of the earlier step . 
 not being measured in the partial - collapse stage ( null outcome ) leads to a non - trivial correlation between the two measurements .

"the ground - state correlations are investigated for an isotropic transverse xy chain which is constrained to carry either a current of magnetization @xmath0 or a current of energy @xmath1 . 
 we find that the effect of @xmath2 on the large - distance decay of correlations is twofold : i ) oscillations are introduced and ii ) the amplitude of the power law decay increases with increasing current . 
 the effect of energy current is more complex . 
 generically , correlations in current carrying states are found to decay faster than in the @xmath3 states , contrary to expectations that correlations are increased by the presence of currents . 
 however , increasing the current , one reaches a special line where the correlations become comparable to those of the @xmath4 states . on this line , 
 the symmetry of the ground state is enhanced and the transverse magnetization vanishes . 
 further increase of the current destroys the extra symmetry but the transverse magnetization remains at the high - symmetry , zero value .

"a new class of pattern forming systems is identified and investigated : anisotropic systems that are spatially inhomogeneous along the direction perpendicular to the preferred one . by studying the generic amplitude equation of this new class and a model equation , 
 we show that branched stripe patterns emerge , which for a given parameter set are stable within a band of different wavenumbers and different numbers of branching points ( defects ) . 
 moreover , the branched patterns and unbranched ones ( defect - free stripes ) coexist over a finite parameter range .

"we numerically study the tidal instability of accretion discs in close binary systems using a two - dimensional sph code . 
 we find that the precession rate of tidally unstable , eccentric discs does not only depend upon the binary mass ratio @xmath0 . 
 although the ( prograde ) disc precession rate increases with the strength of the tidal potential , we find that increasing the shear viscosity @xmath1 also has a significant prograde effect . increasing the disc temperature has a retrograde impact upon the precession rate . 
 we find that motion relative to the binary potential results in superhump - like , periodic luminosity variations in the outer reaches of an eccentric disc . 
 the nature and location of the luminosity modulation is a function of @xmath1 . 
 light curves most similar to observations are obtained for @xmath1 values appropriate for a dwarf nova in outburst . 
 we investigate the thermal - tidal instability model for superoutburst . 
 a dwarf nova outburst is simulated by instantaneously increasing @xmath1 , which causes a rapid radial expansion of the disc . 
 should the disc encounter the @xmath2 eccentric inner lindblad resonance and become tidally unstable , then tidal torques become much more efficient at removing angular momentum from the disc . 
 the disc then shrinks and @xmath3 increases . 
 the resulting increase in disc luminosity is found to be consistent with the excess luminosity of a superoutburst .

 three of the streams , ranging between 3 and 15 kpc in distance and spanning between 37   and 84   on the sky , are very narrow and are most probably tidal streams originating in extant or disrupted globular clusters . 
 the fourth stream is much broader , roughly 45 kpc distant , at least 53   in length , and is most likely the tidal debris from a dwarf galaxy . as the streams each span multiple constellations , we extend tradition and designate them the acheron , cocytos , lethe , and styx streams . at the same distance and apparently embedded in the styx stream is a @xmath0 kpc - wide concentration of stars with an apparently similar color - magnitude distribution which we designate bootes iii . given its very low surface density , its location within the stream , and its apparently disturbed morphology , we argue that bootes iii may be the progenitor of styx and in possibly the final throes of tidal dissolution . while the current data do not permit strong constraints , preliminary orbit estimates for the streams do not point to any likely progenitors among the known globular clusters and dwarf galaxies ."

"we study the effects of hadronic rescattering on hadron distributions in high - energy nuclear collisions by using an integrated dynamical approach . 
 this approach is based on a hybrid model combining ( 3 + 1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamics for the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , and a transport model for the hadron resonance gas . 
 since the hadron distributions are the result of the entire expansion history of the system , understanding the qgp properties requires investigating how rescattering during the hadronic stage affects the final distributions of hadrons . 
 we include multistrange hadrons in our study , and quantify the effects of hadronic rescattering on their mean transverse momenta and elliptic flow . 
 we find that multistrange hadrons scatter less during the hadronic stage than non - strange particles , and thus their distributions reflect the properties of the system in an earlier stage than the distributions of non - strange particles ."

 the vortex properties of the many - particle wave function of the ground state are studied and for large magnetic fields are related to composite fermions . 
 the position of the impurity influences strongly the spin pair correlation function when the external field is large

"we present new results on [ cii]158@xmath0 emission from four galaxies in the reionization epoch . 
 these galaxies were previously confirmed to be at redshifts between 6.6 and 7.15 from the presence of the ly@xmath1 emission line in their spectra . 
 the ly@xmath1 emission line is redshifted by 100 - 200 km s@xmath2 compared to the systemic redshift given by the [ cii ] line . 
 these velocity offsets are smaller than what is observed in @xmath3 lyman break galaxies with similar uv luminosities and emission line properties . 
 smaller velocity shifts reduce the visibility of ly@xmath1 and hence somewhat alleviate the need for a very neutral igm at @xmath4 7 to explain the drop in the fraction of ly@xmath1 emitters observed at this epoch . 
 the galaxies show [ cii ] emission with l[cii]=@xmath5 : these luminosities place them consistently below the sfr - l[cii ] relation observed for low redshift star forming and metal poor galaxies and also below z=5.5 lyman break galaxies with similar star formation rates . we argue that previous undetections of [ cii ] in @xmath47 galaxies with similar or smaller star formation rates are due to selection effects : previous targets were mostly strong ly@xmath1 emitters and therefore probably metal poor systems , while our galaxies are more representative of the general high redshift star forming population ."

"in this paper we study centrifugal acceleration of particles moving along a prescribed rotating curved trajectories . 
 we consider the physical system embedded in an isotropic photon field and study the influence of the photon drag force on the acceleration process .

 we have found several interesting features of motion . in particular , it has been shown that for rectilinear field lines the particles reach the light cylinder ( area where the linear velocity of rotation exactly equals the speed of light ) zone relatively slowly for bigger drag forces . 
 considering the archimede s spiral , we have found that in cases when the field lines lag behind the rotation , the particles achieve the force - free regime of dynamics regardless of the drag force . unlike this scenario , when the spiral is screwed up in an opposite direction there the particles do not reach the force free regime , but tend to stable equilibrium locations .

 we also show that proper estimation of the equation of state of dark energy at the high redshifts would be impossible at the current status of observations .

"we show that tools from circuit complexity can be used to study decompositions of global constraints . 
 in particular , we study decompositions of global constraints into conjunctive normal form with the property that unit propagation on the decomposition enforces the same level of consistency as a specialized propagation algorithm . 
 we prove that a constraint propagator has a a polynomial size decomposition if and only if it can be computed by a polynomial size monotone boolean circuit . 
 lower bounds on the size of monotone boolean circuits thus translate to lower bounds on the size of decompositions of global constraints . for instance 
 , we prove that there is no polynomial sized decomposition of the domain consistency propagator for the constraint ."
"we present new calculations for the stark broadening of the hydrogen line profiles in the dense atmospheres of white dwarf stars . 
 our improved model is based on the unified theory of stark broadening from vidal , cooper & smith , but it also includes non - ideal gas effects from the hummer & mihalas occupation probability formalism directly inside the line profile calculations . 
 this approach improves upon previous calculations that relied on the use of an ad - hoc free parameter to describe the dissolution of the line wing opacity in the presence of high electric microfields in the plasma . 
 we present here the first grid of model spectra for hot ( @xmath0  k ) da white dwarfs that has no free parameters . 
 the atmospheric parameters obtained from optical and uv spectroscopic observations using these improved models are shown to differ substantially from those published in previous studies ."
"we report total - energy calculations based on the density - functional theory that clarify microscopic mechanisms of initial stage of graphene formation on the sic(0001 ) surface . 
 we explore favorable reactions for desorption of either si or c atoms from the stepped surface by determining the desorption and the subsequent migration pathways and calculating the corresponding energy barriers for the first time . 
 we find that the energy barrier for the desorption of an si atom at the step edge and the subsequent migration toward stable terrace sites are lower than that of a c atom by 0.75 ev , indicative of the selective desorption of si from the sic surface . 
 we also find that the subsequent si desorption is an exothermic reaction . 
 this exothermicity comes from the energy gain due to the bond formation of c atoms being left near the step edges . 
 this is certainly a seed of graphene flakes ."
"a study of the dynamics of the positive charges in liquid argon has been carried out in the context of the future massive time projection chambers proposed for dark matter and neutrino physics . 
 given their small mobility coefficient in liquid argon , the ions spend a considerably longer time in the active volume with respect to the electrons . 
 the positive charge density can be additionally increased by the injection , in the liquid volume , of the ions produced by the electron multiplying devices located in gas argon . 
 the impact of the ion current on the uniformity of the field has been evaluated as well as the probability of the charge signal quenching due to the electron - ion recombination along the drift . 
 the study results show some potential concerns for massive detectors with drift of many meters operated on surface ."
"this report covers investigation of the structural properties of surfaces of si epitaxial layers deposited on si(001 ) vicinal substrates with different miscuts .

 we suppose these effects to be connected with interaction of monoatomic steps ."
"the systematics of ob spectra are reviewed in the optical domain , dominated by photospheric lines , and in the far ultraviolet ( both _ iue _ and _ fuse _ ranges ) , in which the stellar - wind profiles dominate . 
 first , the two - dimensional ( temperature , luminosity ) trends in normal spectra are surveyed . 
 then , the normal reference frame having been established , various categories of peculiar objects can be distinguished relative to it , which reveal several phenomena of structural and/or evolutionary significance . included are cno anomalies at both early and late o types , three varieties of rapid rotators , hot and cool of / wn transition objects , and the recently discovered second known magnetic o star . the importance of both optical and uv observations to understand these phenomena is emphasized ; for instance , progress in understanding the structure of the new o - type magnetic oblique rotator is hampered by the current lack of a uv spectrograph . 
 while progress in the physical interpretation of these trends and anomalies has been and is being made , increased attention to modeling the systematics would accelerate future progress in this author s opinion . 
 finally , preliminary results from a _ chandra _ high - resolution survey of ob x - ray spectra ( pi w. waldron ) are presented . 
 they provide evidence that , just as emerged earlier in the uv , systematic morphological trends exist in the x - ray domain that are correlated with the optical spectral types , and hence the fundamental stellar parameters , contrary to prevailing opinion ."
"we discuss a few current developments in the use of quantum mechanically coherent systems for information processing . in each of these developments , 
 rolf landauer has played a crucial role in nudging us and other workers in the field into asking the right questions , some of which we have been lucky enough to answer . a general overview of the key ideas of quantum error correction is given . 
 we discuss how quantum entanglement is the key to protecting quantum states from decoherence in a manner which , in a theoretical sense , is as effective as the protection of digital data from bit noise . 
 we also discuss five general criteria which must be satisfied to implement a quantum computer in the laboratory , and we illustrate the application of these criteria by discussing our ideas for creating a quantum computer out of the spin states of coupled quantum dots ."
"we propose a new eulerian numerical approach for constructing the forward flow maps in continuous dynamical systems . 
 the new algorithm improves the original formulation developed in @xcite so that the associated partial differential equations ( pdes ) are solved forward in time and , therefore , the _ forward _ flow map can now be determined _ on the fly_. due to the simplicity in the implementations , we are now able to efficiently compute the unstable coherent structures in the flow based on quantities like the finite time lyapunov exponent ( ftle ) , the finite size lyapunov exponent ( fsle ) and also a related infinitesimal size lyapunov exponent ( isle ) . when applied to the isle computations , the eulerian method is in particularly computational efficient . for each separation factor 
 @xmath0 in the definition of the isle , typical lagrangian methods require to shoot and monitor an individual set of ray trajectories . 
 if the scale factor in the definition is changed , these methods have to restart the whole computations all over again . 
 the proposed eulerian method , however , requires to extract only an isosurface of a volumetric data for an individual value of @xmath0 which can be easily done using any well - developed efficient interpolation method or simply an isosurface extraction algorithm . 
 moreover , we provide a theoretical link between the ftle and the isle fields which explains the similarity in these solutions observed in various applications ."
"a more extended low density region of coexisting uniform antiferromagnetism and d - wave superconductivity has been reported in multilayer cuprates , when compared to single or bilayer cuprates . 
 this coexistence could be due to the enhanced screening of random potential modulations in inner layers or to the interlayer heisenberg and josephson couplings . 
 a theoretical analysis using a renormalized mean field theory , favors the former explanation . 
 the potential for an improved determination of the antiferromagnetic and superconducting order parameters in an ideal single layer from zero field nmr and infrared josephson plasma resonances in multilayer cuprates is discussed ."
"we consider a georgi - glashow model conformally coupled to gravity . 
 the conformally invariant action includes a triplet of scalar fields and @xmath0 non - abelian gauge fields . 
 however , the usual mass term @xmath1 is forbidden by the symmetry and this role is now played by the conformal coupling of the ricci scalar to the scalar fields . spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs via gravitation . 
 the spherically symmetric solutions correspond to localized solitons ( magnetic monopoles ) in asymptotically anti - de - sitter ( ads ) space - time and the metric outside the core of the monopole is found to be schwarzschild - ads . 
 though conformal symmetry excludes the einstein - hilbert term in the original action , it emerges in the effective action after spontaneous symmetry breaking and dominates the low - energy / long - distance regime outside the core of the monopole .

"grover s algorithm for quantum search can also be applied to classical energy transfer . 
 the procedure takes a system in which the total energy is equally distributed among @xmath0 subsystems and transfers most of the it to one marked subsystem . 
 we show that in a relativistic setting the efficiency of this procedure can be improved . 
 we will consider the transfer of relativistic kinetic energy in a series of elastic collisions . in this case , the number of steps of the energy transfer procedure approaches 1 as the initial velocities of the objects become closer to the speed of light . 
 this is a consequence of introducing non - linearities in the procedure . 
 however , the maximum attainable transfer will depend on the particular combination of speed and number of objects . in the procedure 
 , we will use @xmath0 elements , like in the classical case , instead of the @xmath1 states of the quantum algorithm ."
"we obtain new hi and @xmath0co images around supernova remnants ( snr ) kes 69 and g21.5 - 0.9 . by comparing hi spectra with @xmath0co emission spectra , we significantly revise the kinematic distance for kes 69 to @xmath1 5.5 kpc , which was 11.2 kpc , and refine the kinematic distance for g21.5 - 0.9 to @xmath1 4.8 kpc . for kes 69 , 
 the highest velocity of absorption is @xmath1 86 km s@xmath2 and a prominent hi emission feature at @xmath1 112 km s@xmath2 has no respective absorption . 
 these new results suggest that kes 69 is associated with a newly detected extended 1720 mhz oh maser at velocity of @xmath1 85 km s@xmath2 that originates from within the bright southern radio shell of kes 69 . for g21.5 - 0.9 , 
 the highest velocity of absorption is @xmath1 67 km s@xmath2 . 
 the hi absorption spectra of the nearby bright source pmn j1832 - 1035 and of kes 69 show a common absorption feature at velocity of @xmath1 69 km s@xmath2 , which is not seen for g21.5 - 0.9

"two decades after the discovery of 51  peg  b , the formation processes and atmospheres of short - period gas giants remain poorly understood . observations of eccentric systems provide key insights on those topics as they can illuminate how a planet s atmosphere responds to changes in incident flux . 
 we report here the analysis of multi - day multi - channel photometry of the eccentric ( @xmath0 ) hot jupiter hd  80606  b obtained with the _ spitzer space telescope_. the planet s extreme eccentricity combined with the long coverage and exquisite precision of new periastron - passage observations allow us to break the degeneracy between the radiative and dynamical timescales of hd  80606  b s atmosphere and constrain its global thermal response . 
 our analysis reveals that the atmospheric layers probed heat rapidly ( @xmath1-hr radiative timescale ) from @xmath2k to 1400k as they absorb @xmath3 of the incoming stellar flux during the periastron passage , while the planet s rotation period is @xmath4 hours , which exceeds the predicted pseudo - synchronous period ( 40 hours ) ."
"in this paper we investigate the possibility of measuring the post - newtonian general relativistic gravitomagnetic lense - thirring effect in the jovian system of its galilean satellites io , europa , ganymede and callisto in view of recent developments in processing and modelling their optical observations spanning a large time interval ( 125 years ) . 
 the present day best observations have an accuracy between several kilometers to few tens of kilometers , which is just the order of magnitude of the lense - thirring shifts of the orbits of the galilean satellites over almost a century . from a comparison between analytical development and numerical integration 
 it turns out that , unfortunately , most of the secular component of the gravitomagnetic signature is removed in the process of fitting the initial conditions . 
 indeed , an estimation of the magnitude of the lense - thirring effect in the ephemerides residuals is given ; the resulting residuals have a maximum magnitude of 20 meters only ( over 125 years ) ."

"+ it is shown that different distinguishability measures impose different orderings on ensembles of @xmath0 pure quantum states . 
 this is demonstrated using ensembles of equally - probable , linearly independent , symmetrical pure states , with the maximum probabilities of correct hypothesis testing and unambiguous state discrimination being the distinguishability measures . 
 this finding implies that there is no absolute scale for comparing the distinguishability of any two ensembles of @xmath0 quantum states , and that distinguishability comparison is necessarily relative to a particular discrimination strategy ."
"we derive general results for the mass shift of bound states with angular momentum @xmath0 in a periodic cubic box in two and three spatial dimensions .

 the sign of the mass shift can be related to the symmetry properties of the state under consideration .

 moreover , we comment on the relations connecting the effective range parameter , the binding momentum of a given state and the asymptotic normalization coefficient of the corresponding wave function . 
 we give explicit expressions for this relation in the shallow binding limit ."
"we construct a model of cyg x-1 which describes self - consistently its emission from soft x - rays to mev @xmath0-rays . instead of a compact pair - dominated @xmath0-ray emitting region

 the @xmath0-ray emission is due to bremsstrahlung , comptonization , and positron annihilation , while the corona - disc model is retained for the x - ray emission . 
 we show that the cyg x-1 spectrum accumulated by osse , batse , and comptel in 199195 , as well as the heao-3 @xmath1 and @xmath2 spectra can be well fitted by our model ( see @xcite for details ) .

"we study the stochastic behavior of heterogeneous diffusion processes with the power - law dependence @xmath0 of the generalized diffusion coefficient encompassing sub- and superdiffusive anomalous diffusion . based on statistical measures such as 
 the amplitude scatter of the time averaged mean squared displacement of individual realizations , the ergodicity breaking and non - gaussianity parameters , as well as the probability density function @xmath1 we analyze the weakly non - ergodic character of the heterogeneous diffusion process and , particularly , the degree of irreproducibility of individual realization . as we show 
 , the fluctuations between individual realizations increase with growing modulus @xmath2 of the scaling exponent . 
 the fluctuations appear to diverge when the critical value @xmath3 is approached , while for even larger @xmath4 the fluctuations decrease , again . at criticality , 
 the power - law behavior of the mean squared displacement changes to an exponentially fast growth , and the fluctuations of the time averaged mean squared displacement do not seem to converge for increasing number of realizations . from a systematic comparison we observe some striking similarities of the heterogeneous diffusion process with the familiar subdiffusive continuous time random walk process with power - law waiting time distribution and diverging characteristic waiting time ."
"a solar - type dynamo model in a spherical shell is developed with allowance for random dependence of the poloidal field generation mechanism on time and latitude . 
 the model shows repeatable epochs of strongly decreased amplitude of magnetic cycles similar to the maunder minimum of solar activity . 
 random dependence of dynamo - parameters on latitude brakes the equatorial symmetry of generated fields . 
 the model shows the correlation of the occurrence of grand minima with deviations in the dynamo - field from dipolar parity . 
 an increased north - south asymmetry of magnetic activity can , therefore , be an indicator of transitions to grand minima . qualitative interpretation of this correlation is suggested . 
 statistics of grand minima in the model are close to the poisson random process indicating that the onset of a grand minimum is statistically independent of preceding minima ."

"we present a study of site and bond percolation on periodic lattices with ( on average ) fewer than three nearest neighbors per site . 
 we have studied this issue in two contexts : by simulating oxides with a mixture of 2-coordinated and higher - coordinated sites , and by mapping site - bond percolation results onto a site model with mixed coordination number . 
 our results show that a conjectured power - law relationship between coordination number and site percolation threshold holds approximately if the coordination number is defined as the average number of connections available between high - coordinated sites , and suggest that the conjectured power - law relationship reflects a real phenomenon requiring further study . 
 the solution may be to modify the power - law relationship to be an implicit formula for percolation threshold , one that takes into account aspects of the lattice beyond spatial dimension and average coordination number .

 melting of the system with intermediate range potential shows a hexatic - like feature near the melting transition in @xmath1 ensemble , but it undergoes an unstable hexatic - like phase during melting process in @xmath0 ensemble , which implies existence of a weakly first order transition .

"recent years have witnessed several initiatives on enabling internet access to the next three billion people . 
 access to the internet necessarily translates to access to its services . 
 this means that the goal of providing internet access requires access to its critical service infrastructure , which are currently hosted in the cloud .

"we have analyzed the archival _ xmm - newton _ data of the bright ultra - luminous x - ray source ( ulx ) m82 x-1 with an 105 ksec exposure when the source was in the steady state . 
 thanks to the high photon statistics from the large effective area and long exposure , we were able to discriminate different x - ray continuum spectral models . neither the standard accretion disk model ( where the radial dependency of the disk effective temperature is @xmath0 ) nor a power - law model gives a satisfactory fit . 
 in fact , observed curvature of the m82 x-1 spectrum was just between those of the two models . 
 when the exponent of the radial dependence ( @xmath1 in @xmath2 ) of the disk temperature is allowed to be free , we obtained @xmath3 . 
 such a reduction of @xmath1 from the standard value 3/4 under extremely high mass accretion rates is predicted from the accretion disk theory as a consequence of the radial energy advection . 
 thus , the accretion disk in m82 x-1 is considered to be in the _ slim disk _ state , where an optically thick advection dominant accretion flow ( adaf ) is taking place . 
 we have applied a theoretical slim disk spectral model to m82 x-1 , and estimated the black hole mass @xmath4 .

"this paper includes a reflection on the role of networks in the study of english language acquisition , as well as a collection of practical criteria to annotate free - speech corpora from children utterances . at the theoretical level 
 , the main claim of this paper is that syntactic networks should be interpreted as the outcome of the use of the syntactic machinery . 
 thus , the intrinsic features of such machinery are not accessible directly from ( known ) network properties . 
 rather , what one can see are the global patterns of its use and , thus , a global view of the power and organization of the underlying grammar . taking a look into more practical issues , 
 the paper examines how to build a net from the projection of syntactic relations . 
 recall that , as opposed to adult grammars , early - child language has not a well - defined concept of structure . to overcome such difficulty 
 , we develop a set of systematic criteria assuming constituency hierarchy and a grammar based on lexico - thematic relations . at the end , what we obtain is a well defined corpora annotation that enables us i ) to perform statistics on the size of structures and ii ) to build a network from syntactic relations over which we can perform the standard measures of complexity .

"it has been alleged in several papers that the so called delayed continuous - time random walks ( dctrws ) provide a model for the one - dimensional telegraph equation at microscopic level . 
 this conclusion , being widespread now , is strange , since the telegraph equation describes phenomena with finite propagation speed , while the velocity of the motion of particles in the dctrws is infinite . in this paper 
 we investigate how accurate are the approximations to the dctrws provided by the telegraph equation . 
 we show that the diffusion equation , being the correct limit of the dctrws , gives better approximations in @xmath0 norm to the dctrws than the telegraph equation . 
 we conclude therefore that , first , the dctrws do not provide any correct microscopic interpretation of the one - dimensional telegraph equation , and second , the kinetic ( exact ) model of the telegraph equation is different from the model based on the dctrws .

"in this communication a new algorithm is proposed to produce surrogates for pseudoperiodic time series . by imposing a few constraints on the noise components of pseudoperiodic data sets 
 , we devise an effective method to generate surrogates . 
 unlike other algorithms , this method properly copes with pseudoperiodic orbits contaminated with linear colored observational noise . 
 we will demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to distinguish chaotic orbits from pseudoperiodic orbits through simulation data sets from the rssler system .

"the one - dimensional totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) is considered .

 calculated is the multi - time joint distribution function of its position . using the relation of the dynamics of the tasep to the schur process , we show that the function is represented as the fredholm determinant . 
 we also study the scaling limit . 
 the universality of the largest eigenvalue in the random matrix theory is realized in the limit . when the hopping rates of all particles are the same , it is found that the joint distribution function converges to that of the airy process after the time at which the particle begins to move . on the other hand , when there are several particles with small hopping rate in front of a tagged particle , the limiting process changes at a certain time from the airy process to the process of the largest eigenvalue in the hermitian multi - matrix model with external sources .

"a view of the galactic bulge by means of their globular clusters is necessary for a deep understanding of its formation and evolution . 
 connections between the globular cluster and field star properties in terms of kinematics , orbits , chemical abundances and ages should shed light on different stellar population components .

 these candidates might alleviate the issue of missing clusters on the far side of the bulge .

 both objects are known radio emitters with strong evidence for periodic emission on timescales of about 2 and 3 hours , respectively . using the inner seven vlba antennas 
 , we detect unresolved emission from tvlm51346546 on a scale of 2.5 mas ( @xmath0 stellar radii ) , leading to a direct limit on the radio emission brightness temperature of @xmath1 k. however , with the higher spatial resolution afforded by the full vlba we find that the source appears to be marginally and asymmetrically resolved at a low s / n ratio , possibly indicating that tvlm51346546 is a binary with a projected separation of @xmath2 mas ( @xmath3 stellar radii ) . using the 7-hr baseline of our observation

 we show that the statistics are not homogeneous - they separate sharply to a regime of ` small ' and ` large ' drops , each endowed with its own scaling properties .

"mergers of two carbon - oxygen white dwarfs have long been suspected to be progenitors of type ia supernovae . here 
 we present our modifications to the cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics code gadget to apply it to stellar physics including but not limited to mergers of white dwarfs . 
 we demonstrate a new method to map a one - dimensional profile of an object in hydrostatic equilibrium to a stable particle distribution . 
 we use the code to study the effect of initial conditions and resolution on the properties of the merger of two white dwarfs . we compare mergers with approximate and exact binary initial conditions and find that exact binary initial conditions lead to a much more stable binary system but there is no difference in the properties of the actual merger . 
 in contrast , we find that resolution is a critical issue for simulations of white dwarf mergers . 
 carbon burning hotspots which may lead to a detonation in the so - called violent merger scenario emerge only in simulations with sufficient resolution but independent of the type of binary initial conditions . 
 we conclude that simulations of white dwarf mergers which attempt to investigate their potential for type ia supernovae should be carried out with at least @xmath0 particles .

"as some of the first known objects to exist in the universe , lyman alpha emitting galaxies ( laes ) naturally draw a lot of interest . first discovered over a decade ago , they have allowed us to probe the early universe , as their strong emission line compensates for their faint continuum light . while initially thought to be indicative of the first galaxies forming in the universe , recent studies have shown them to be increasingly complex , as some fraction appear evolved , and many laes appear to be dusty , which one would not expect from primordial galaxies .

"this work presents a sound probabilistic method for enforcing adherence of the marginal probabilities of a multi - label model to automatically discovered deterministic relationships among labels .

 the second concerns exclusion : sets of labels that do not coexist in the same instances of the dataset . 
 these relationships are represented with a bayesian network . 
 marginal probabilities are entered as soft evidence in the network and adjusted through probabilistic inference . 
 our approach offers robust improvements in mean average precision compared to the standard binary relavance approach across all 12 datasets involved in our experiments .

 the original continuous phase symmetry of the system is replaced by a discrete one , so that phase bistability emerges . 
 this leads to the spontaneous formation of phase - locked spatial structures like phase domains and dark - ring ( phase- ) cavity solitons . 
 stability of the homogeneous solutions is studied and numerical simulations are made covering all the dynamical regimes of the model , which turn out to be very rich .

"adaptive populations such as those in financial markets and distributed control can be modeled by the minority game . 
 we consider how their dynamics depends on the agents initial preferences of strategies , when the agents use linear or quadratic payoff functions to evaluate their strategies . 
 we find that the fluctuations of the population making certain decisions ( the volatility ) depends on the diversity of the distribution of the initial preferences of strategies . 
 when the diversity decreases , more agents tend to adapt their strategies together . in systems with linear payoffs , 
 this results in dynamical transitions from vanishing volatility to a non - vanishing one . for low signal dimensions , the dynamical transitions for the different signals do not take place at the same critical diversity . 
 rather , a cascade of dynamical transitions takes place when the diversity is reduced . 
 in contrast , no phase transitions are found in systems with the quadratic payoffs . 
 instead , a basin boundary of attraction separates two groups of samples in the space of the agents decisions . 
 initial states inside this boundary converge to small volatility , while those outside diverge to a large one . 
 furthermore , when the preference distribution becomes more polarized , the dynamics becomes more erratic . 
 all the above results are supported by good agreement between simulations and theory ."
"1-qubit quantum states form a space called the three - dimensional bloch ball . to compute holevo capacity , voronoi diagrams in the bloch ball with respect to the quantum divergence

 these diagrams basically treat mixed quantum states corresponding to points in the interior of the bloch ball . due to the existence of logarithm in the quantum divergence

 this paper first defines the voronoi diagrams for pure quantum states on the bloch sphere by the fubini - study distance and the bures distance .

"ethane is expected to be the dominant photochemical product on titan s surface and , in the absence of a process that sequesters it from exposed surface reservoirs , a major constituent of its lakes and seas . 
 absorption of cassini s 2.2 cm radar by ligeia mare however suggests that this north polar sea is dominated by methane . in order to explain this apparent ethane deficiency 
 , we explore the possibility that ligeia mare is the visible part of an alkanofer that interacted with an underlying clathrate layer and investigate the influence of this interaction on an assumed initial ethane - methane mixture in the liquid phase . 
 we find that progressive liquid entrapment in clathrate allows the surface liquid reservoir to become methane - dominated for any initial ethane mole fraction below 0.75 . 
 if interactions between alkanofers and clathrates are common on titan , this should lead to the emergence of many methane - dominated seas or lakes .

"we present the results of numerical simulations of continuum - driven winds of stars that exceed the eddington limit and compare these against predictions from earlier analytical solutions . 
 our models are based on the assumption that the stellar atmosphere consists of clumped matter , where the individual clumps have a much larger optical thickness than the matter between the clumps . 
 this ` porosity ' of the stellar atmosphere reduces the coupling between radiation and matter , since photons tend to escape through the more tenuous gas between the clumps . 
 this allows a star that formally exceeds the eddington limit to remain stable , yet produce a steady outflow from the region where the clumps become optically thin . 
 we have made a parameter study of wind models for a variety of input conditions in order to explore the properties of continuum - driven winds . 
 the results show that the numerical simulations reproduce quite closely the analytical scalings . 
 the mass loss rates produced in our models are much larger than can be achieved by line driving . 
 this makes continuum driving a good mechanism to explain the large mass loss and flow speeds of giant outbursts , as observed in @xmath0  carinae and other luminous blue variable ( lbv ) stars . 
 continuum driving may also be important in population iii stars , since line driving becomes ineffective at low metalicities . 
 we also explore the effect of photon tiring and the limits it places on the wind parameters .

"emerging technologies with asymptotic zero power dissipation , such as quantum computing , require the logical operations to be done in a reversible manner . 
 in recent years , the problem of synthesizing boolean functions in the reversible logic domain has gained significant research attention . 
 the efficiency of the synthesis methods is measured in terms of quantum cost , gate cost , garbage lines , logic depth and speed of synthesis . in this paper 
 , we present a modification of the existing approaches based on exclusive sum - of - products ( esop ) , which allows to explore the trade - off between quantum cost and garbage lines . 
 the proposed technique adds a new dimension to the reversible logic synthesis solutions . 
 we demonstrate by detailed experiments that controlled improvement in quantum cost and gate count by increasing garbage count can be achieved . in some cases , improved quantum cost and gate count compared to state - of - the - art synthesis methods 
 are reported . 
 furthermore , we propose a novel rule - based approach to achieve ancilla - free reversible logic synthesis starting from an esop formulation ."
"in this paper we present evidence suggesting that the absence or presence of hidden broad line regions ( hblrs ) in seyfert 2 galaxies is regulated by the rate at which matter accretes onto a central supermassive black hole , in units of eddington rate . 
 evidence is based on data from a subsample of type 2 agns extracted from the tran ( 2001 ) spectropolarimetric sample and made up of all those sources that also have good quality x - ray spectra available , and for which a bulge luminosity can be estimated . 
 we use the intrinsic ( i.e. unabsorbed ) x - ray luminosities of these sources and their black hole masses ( estimated by using the well known relationship between nuclear mass and bulge luminosity in galaxies ) to derive the nuclear accretion rate in units of eddington . 
 we find that virtually all hblr sources have accretion rate larger than a threshold value of @xmath0 ( in eddington units ) , while non - hblr sources lie at @xmath1 . 
 these data nicely fit predictions from a model proposed by nicastro ( 2000 ) , in which the broad line regions ( blrs ) are formed by accretion disk instabilities occurring in proximity of the critical radius at which the disk changes from gas pressure dominated to radiation pressure dominated . 
 this radius diminishes with decreasing @xmath2 ; for low enough accretion rates ( and therefore luminosities ) , the critical radius becomes smaller than the innermost stable orbit , and blrs can not form ."
"at low volume fraction , disordered arrangements of frictionless spheres are found in un

 we show , focusing on the hard sphere zero pressure limit , that the transition between un - jammed and jammed states does not occur at a single value of the volume fraction , but in a whole volume fraction range . this result is obtained via the direct numerical construction of disordered jammed states with a volume fraction varying between two limits , @xmath0 and @xmath1 . 
 we identify these limits with the random loose packing volume fraction @xmath2 and the random close packing volume fraction @xmath3 of frictionless spheres , respectively ."

 the profiles analysed are those of the balmer , h@xmath0  and h@xmath1 , and d3 ( @xmath2 5876  ) lines . 
 we analyse the balmer line variability and phase behaviour . 
 we confirm these lines as highly variable , with excess emission that originates from extended structures and exhibits clear signs of rotational modulation . 
 we have described the line profiles for two distinct states of activity , using different modelling approaches . 
 similar techniques were applied to the d3 spectra . 
 a large flare event lasting several days was detected in both balmer lines and in the d3 line . 
 the energy released during this flare in h@xmath0  is of the order of 10@xmath3  erg , making it the largest h@xmath0  flare reported on a cool star .

"in an emergency situation , imitation of strategies of neighbours can lead to an order - disorder phase transition , where spatial clusters of pedestrians adopt the same strategy . 
 we assume that there are two strategies , cooperating and competitive , which correspond to a smaller or larger desired velocity . 
 the results of our simulations within the social force model indicate that the ordered phase can be detected as an increase of spatial order of positions of the pedestrians in the crowd ."
"the public goods game is one of the most famous models for studying the evolution of cooperation in sizable groups . 
 the multiplication factor in this game can characterize the investment return from the public good , which may be variable depending on the interactive environment in realistic situations . instead of using the same universal value , 
 here we consider that the multiplication factor in each group is updated based on the differences between the local and global interactive environments in the spatial public goods game , but meanwhile limited to within a certain range . 
 we find that the adaptive and bounded investment returns can significantly promote cooperation . 
 in particular , full cooperation can be achieved for high feedback strength when appropriate limitation is set for the investment return . also , we show that the fraction of cooperators in the whole population can become larger if the lower and upper limits of the multiplication factor are increased . 
 furthermore , in comparison to the traditionally spatial public goods game where the multiplication factor in each group is identical and fixed , we find that cooperation can be better promoted if the multiplication factor is constrained to adjust between one and the group size in our model . 
 our results highlight the importance of the locally adaptive and bounded investment returns for the emergence and dominance of cooperative behavior in structured populations ."
"the maximum synchrotron burnoff limit of 160 mev represents a fundamental limit to radiation resulting from electromagnetic particle acceleration in one - zone ideal plasmas . in magnetic reconnection , however , particle acceleration and radiation are decoupled because the electric field is larger than the magnetic field in the diffusion region . 
 we carry out two - dimensional particle - in - cell simulations to determine the extent to which magnetic reconnection can produce synchrotron radiation above the burnoff limit . 
 we use the test particle comparison ( tpc ) method to isolate the effects of cooling by comparing the trajectories and acceleration efficiencies of test particles incident on such a reconnection region with and without cooling them . 
 we find that the cooled and uncooled particle trajectories are typically similar during acceleration in the reconnection region , and derive an effective limit on particle acceleration that is inversely proportional to the average magnetic field experienced by the particle during acceleration . using the calculated distribution of this average magnetic field as a function of uncooled final particle energy , we find analytically that cooling does not affect power - law particle energy spectra except at energies far above the synchrotron burnoff limit . finally , we compare fully cooled and uncooled simulations of reconnection , confirming that the synchrotron burnoff limit does not produce a cutoff in the particle energy spectrum . 
 our results indicate that the tpc method accurately predicts the effects of cooling on particle acceleration in relativistic reconnection , and that even far above the burnoff limit , the synchrotron energy of radiation produced in reconnection is not limited by cooling ."
"we perform spherically - symmetric general - relativistic simulations of core collapse and the postbounce preexplosion phase in 32 presupernova stellar models of solar metallicity with zero - age - main - sequence masses of @xmath0 to @xmath1 . using energy - dependent three - species neutrino transport in the two - moment approximation with an analytic closure , 
 we show that the emitted neutrino luminosities and spectra follow very systematic trends that are correlated with the compactness ( @xmath2 ) of the progenitor star s inner regions via the accretion rate in the preexplosion phase . 
 we find that these qualitative trends depend only weakly on the nuclear equation of state , but quantitative observational statements will require independent constraints on the equation of state and the rotation rate of the core as well as a more complete understanding of neutrino oscillations . we investigate the simulated response of water cherenkov detectors to the electron antineutrino fluxes from our models and find that the large statistics of a galactic core collapse event may allow robust conclusions on the inner structure of the progenitor star ."
"we study the binary fraction of the globular cluster m10 ( ngc  6254 ) as a function of radius from the cluster core to the outskirts , by means of a quantitative analysis of the color distribution of stars relative to the fiducial main sequence . by taking advantage of two data - sets , acquired with the advanced camera for survey and the wide field planetary camera 2 on board the hubble space telescope , 
 we have studied both the core and the external regions of the cluster . 
 the binary fraction is found to decrease from @xmath0 within the core , to @xmath1 in a region between 1 and 2 half - mass radii from the cluster centre . 
 such a trend and the derived values are in agreement with previous results obtained in clusters of comparable total magnitude . 
 the estimated binary fraction is sufficient to account for the suppression of mass segregation observed in m10 , without any need to invoke the presence of an intermediate - mass black hole in its centre ."

"clumping in hot star winds can significantly affect estimates of mass - loss rates , the inferred evolution of the star and the environmental impact of the wind . 
 a hydrodynamical simulation of a colliding winds binary ( cwb ) with clumpy winds reveals that the clumps are rapidly destroyed after passing through the confining shocks of the wind - wind collision region ( wcr ) for reasonable parameters of the clumps if the flow in the wcr is adiabatic . despite large density and temperature fluctuations in the post - shock gas , the overall effect of the interaction 
 is to smooth the existing structure in the winds . averaged over the entire interaction region , 
 the resulting x - ray emission is very similar to that from the collision of smooth winds . 
 the insensitivity of the x - ray emission to clumping suggests it is an excellent diagnostic of the stellar mass - loss rates ( @xmath0 ) in wide cwbs , and may prove to be a useful addition to existing techniques for deriving @xmath0 , many of which are extremely sensitive to clumping . 
 clumpy winds also have implications for a variety of phenomena at the wcr : particle acceleration may occur _ throughout _ the wcr due to supersonic mhd turbulence , re - acceleration at multiple shocks , and re - connection ; a statistical description of the properties of the wcr may be required for studies of non - equilibrium ionization and the rate of electron heating ; and the physical mixing of the two winds will be enhanced , as seems necessary to trigger dust formation ."

 as the alignment angle is varied , the mean - field shift shows a characteristic angular dependence , which constitutes the defining signature of the quadrupole interaction . for the @xmath0 states of yb and sr atoms

"the discovery of transiting `` super - earths '' with inflated radii and known masses such as kepler-11b - f , gj 1214b and 55 cnc e , indicates that these exoplanets did not lose their nebula - captured hydrogen - rich , degassed or impact - delivered protoatmospheres by atmospheric escape processes . because hydrodynamic blow - off of atmospheric hydrogen atoms is the most efficient atmospheric escape process we apply a time - dependent numerical algorithm which is able to solve the system of 1-d fluid equations for mass , momentum , and energy conservation to investigate the criteria under which `` super - earths '' with hydrogen - dominated upper atmospheres can experience hydrodynamic expansion by heating of the stellar xuv ( soft x - rays and extreme ultraviolet ) radiation and thermal escape via blow - off . depending on orbit location , xuv flux , heating efficiency and the planet s mean density our results indicate that the upper atmospheres of all `` super - earths '' can expand to large distances , so that besides of kepler-11c all of them experience atmospheric mass - loss due to roche lobe overflow . 
 the atmospheric mass - loss of the studied `` super - earths '' is one to two orders of magnitude lower compared to that of `` hot jupiters '' such as hd 209458b , so that one can expect that these exoplanets can not lose their hydrogen - envelopes during their remaining lifetimes .

"two of the most attractive spectral windows for spectropolarimetric investigations of the physical properties of the plasma structures in the solar chromosphere and corona are the ones provided by the spectral lines of the he i 10830   and 5876   ( or d@xmath0 ) multiplets , whose polarization signals are sensitive to the hanle and zeeman effects . however , in order to be able to carry out reliable diagnostics , it is crucial to have a good physical understanding of the sensitivity of the observed spectral line radiation to the various competing driving mechanisms . here

 measurements of this observable as a function of the distance to the limb and its confrontation with radiative transfer modeling might give us valuable information on the physical properties of the solar atmosphere and on the amount of euv radiation at relevant wavelengths penetrating the chromosphere from above ."
"we present data from _ integral _ and _ bepposax _ satellites showing spectral state transitions of the neutron - star , atoll - type , low - mass x - ray binary 4u  170544 . 
 its energy spectrum can be described as the sum of one or two blackbody components , a 6.4-kev fe line , and a component due to thermal comptonization . in addition , and for the first time in this source , we find a strong signature of compton reflection , presumably due to illumination of the optically - thick accretion disk by the comptonization spectrum . 
 the two blackbody components , which the soft - state data require , presumably arise from both the disk and the neutron - star surface . 
 the comptonization probably takes place in a hot inner flow irradiated by some of the blackbody photons . 
 the spectral transitions are shown to be associated with variations in the bolometric luminosity , most likely proportional to the accretion rate . 
 indipendentely from the spectral state , we also see changes in the temperature of the comptonizing electrons and the strength of compton reflection ."

 this agreement illustrates the ability of the eob approach to capture the essential physics of coalescing black - hole binaries .

 their apparent speeds @xmath0 ( units of @xmath1 ) range from 3.9 to 13.5 , corresponding to @xmath2 in the galaxy frame . 
 we show that the magnetic field in the jet is well - ordered with a strong transverse component , and assume that it is helical and that the transverse patterns are alfvn waves propagating downstream on the longitudinal component of the magnetic field . 
 the wave - induced transverse speed of the jet is non - relativistic ( @xmath3 ) . in 2010 
 the wave activity subsided and the jet then displayed a mild wiggle that had a complex oscillatory behaviour .

"we report the details and revised analysis of an experiment to measure the specific heat of helium with subnanokelvin temperature resolution near the lambda point . 
 the measurements were made at the vapor pressure spanning the region from 22 mk below the superfluid transition to 4 @xmath0k above . 
 the experiment was performed in earth orbit to reduce the rounding of the transition caused by gravitationally induced pressure gradients on earth . 
 specific heat measurements were made deep in the asymptotic region to within 2 nk of the transition . 
 no evidence of rounding was found to this resolution . 
 the optimum value of the critical exponent describing the specific heat singularity was found to be @xmath1 . 
 this is bracketed by two recent estimates based on renormalization group techniques , but is slightly outside the range of the error of the most recent result . 
 the ratio of the coefficients of the leading order singularity on the two sides of the transition is a@xmath2/a@xmath3@xmath4 , which agrees well with a recent estimate . by combining the specific heat and superfluid density exponents a test of the josephson scaling relation 
 can be made .

"_ we discuss how the conditions at high redshift differ from those at low redshift , and what the impact is on the galaxy population . 
 we focus in particular on the role of gaseous dissipation and its impact on sustaining high star formation rates as well as on driving star - bursts in mergers . 
 gas accretion onto galaxies at high redshifts occurs on a halo dynamical time allowing for very efficiently sustained star formation . 
 in addition cold accretion flows are able to drive turbulence in high redshift disks at the level observed if at least @xmath0 of the accretion energy is converted into random motion in the gaseous disk . in general 
 we find that the fraction of gas involved in galaxy mergers is a strong function of time and increases with redshift . 
 a model combining the role of dissipation during mergers and continued infall of satellite galaxies allows to reproduce the observed size - evolution of early - type galaxies with redshift .

 we suggest that the longer tail arises from highly - scattered paths , possibly from anisotropic scattering or from substructure at large angles ."
"we present gas kinematics based on the [ ] @xmath05007 line and their connection to galaxy gravitational potential , active galactic nucleus ( agn ) energetics , and star formation , using a large sample of @xmath1110,000 agns and star - forming ( sf ) galaxies at z@xmath20.3 . 
 gas and stellar velocity dispersions are comparable to each other in sf galaxies , indicating that the ionized gas kinematics can be accounted by the gravitational potential of host galaxies . in contrast , agns clearly show non - gravitational kinematics , which is comparable to or stronger than the virial motion caused by the gravitational potential . the [ ]  velocity - velocity dispersion ( vvd ) diagram dramatically expands toward high values as a function of agn luminosity , implying that the outflows are agn - driven , while sf galaxies do not show such a trend . 
 we find that the fraction of agns with a signature of outflow kinematics , steeply increases with agn luminosity and eddington ratio . 
 in particular , the majority of luminous agns presents strong non - gravitational kinematics in the [ ]  profile . 
 agns with strong outflow signatures show on average similar specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) to that of starforming galaxies . 
 in contrast , agns with weak or no outflows have an order of magnitude lower ssfr , suggesting that agns with current strong outflows do now show any negative agn feedback and that it may take the order of a dynamical time to impact on star formation over galactic scales ."
"the finite temperature effective potential in the 2 + 1 dimensional nambu - jona - lasinio model is constructed up to the next to leading order in the large @xmath0 expansion , where @xmath0 is the number of flavors in the model . 
 the distinctive feature of the analysis is an inclusion of an additional scalar field , which allows us to circumvent the well known , and otherwise unavoidable problem with the imaginary contribution to the effective potential . in accordance with the mermin - wagner - coleman theorem , applied to the dimensionally reduced subsystem of the zero matsubara modes of the composite boson fields , the finite temperature effective potential reveals a global minimum at the zero of the composite order parameter 
 this allows us to conclude that the continuous global symmetry of the njl model is not broken for any arbitrarily small , finite temperature ."
"for the last three years we have performed a survey for young ( @xmath0 gyrs ) giant planets around nearby white dwarfs with hst , spitzer , and vlt . 
 direct hst / nicmos imaging of the seven white dwarfs in the hyades gave no evidence for companions down to about 10 jupiter masses and separations larger than 0.5 arcsec ( @xmath125au ) , while vlt / naco observations revealed a putative companion to a field white dwarf . 
 second epoch observations with sinfoni on the vlt , however , showed that it is most probably a background star . 
 with irac on spitzer we also found no indications of cool , very low mass companions in our sample of field white dwarfs . 
 the implications of these non - detections are briefly discussed ."
"screening is one of the fundamental concepts in solid state physics . 
 it has a great impact on the electronic properties of graphene where huge mobilities were observed in spite of the large concentration of charged impurities . 
 while static screening has successfully explained dc mobilities , screening properties can be significantly changed at infrared or optical frequencies . in this paper 
 we discuss the influence of dynamical screening on the optical absorption of graphene and other 2d electron systems like metallic monolayers . 
 this research is motivated by recent experimental results which pointed out that graphene plasmon linewidths and optical scattering rates can be much larger than scattering rates determined by dc mobilities . 
 specifically we discuss a process where a photon incident on a graphene plane can excite a plasmon by scattering from an impurity , or surface optical phonon of the substrate ."
"we study the fano effect and the visibility of the aharonov - bohm oscillations for a mesoscopic interferometer with an embedded quantum dot in the presence of a nearby second dot . when the electron - electron interaction between the two dots is considered the nearby dot acts as a charge detector . 
 we compute the currents through the interferometer and detector within the keldysh formalism and the self - energy of the non - equilibrium green functions is found up to the second order in the interaction strength . 
 the current formula contains a correction to the landauer - bttiker formula . 
 its contribution to transport and dephasing is discussed . as the bias applied on the detector 
 is increased , the amplitude of both the fano resonance and aharonov - bohm oscillations are considerably reduced due to controlled dephasing . 
 this result is explained by analyzing the behavior of the imaginary part of the self - energy as a function of energy and bias . 
 we investigate as well the role of the ring - dot coupling . 
 our theoretical results are consistent to the experimental observation of buks _ et al .

"we consider the nonlinear energy conditions and their quantum extensions . 
 these new energy conditions behave much better than the usual pointwise energy conditions in the presence of semiclassical quantum effects . 
 analogous quantum extensions for the linear energy conditions are not always satisfied as one enters the quantum realm , but they can be used to constrain the violation of the classical conditions . 
 thus , the existence of wormholes supported by a fluid which violates the null energy condition in a controlled way is of particular interest ."
"a nonlocal coupling mechanism to directly transfer the energy from large - scale magnetohydrodynamic(mhd ) alfvn waves to small - scale kinetic alfvn waves is presented . 
 it is shown that the interaction between a mhd alfvn wave and a reversely propagating kinetic alfvn wave can generate another kinetic alfvn wave , and this interaction exists in the plasmas where the thermal to magnetic pressure ratio is larger than the electron to ion mass ratio . 
 the proposed nonlocal interaction may have a potential application to account for the observed electron scale kinetic alfvn waves in the solar wind and solar corona plasmas ."
"we present a diagrammatic real - time approach to adiabatic pumping of electrons through interacting quantum dots . performing a systematic perturbation expansion in the tunnel - coupling strength , 
 we compute the charge pumped through a single - level quantum dot per pumping cycle . 
 the combination of coulomb interaction and quantum fluctuations , accounted for in contributions of higher order in the tunnel coupling , modifies the pumping characteristics via an interaction - dependent renormalization of the quantum - dot level . 
 the latter is even responsible for the _ dominant _ contribution to the pumped charge when pumping via time - dependent tunnel - coupling strengths ."
"we show that the @xmath0gev diphoton excess can be explained by introducing vector - like quarks and hidden fermions charged under a hidden u(1 ) gauge symmetry , which has a relatively large coupling constant as well as a significant kinetic mixing with u(1)@xmath1 . with the large kinetic mixing , 
 the standard model gauge couplings unify around @xmath2gev , suggesting the grand unified theory without too rapid proton decay . 
 our scenario predicts events with a photon and missing transverse momentum , and its cross section is related to that for the diphoton excess through the kinetic mixing . 
 we also discuss other possible collider signatures and cosmology , including various ways to evade constraints on exotic stable charged particles . in some cases where the @xmath0gev diphoton excess is due to diaxion decays , our scenario also predicts triphoton and tetraphoton signals .

"we look into the inner structure of a two - dimensional dilatonic evaporating black hole . we establish and employ the homogenous approximation for the black - hole interior .

"we employ density - functional theory ( dft ) in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) and its extensions gga+@xmath0 and gga+gutzwiller to calculate the magnetic exchange couplings between pairs of mn ions substituting cd in a cdte crystal at very small doping . 
 dft(gga ) overestimates the exchange couplings by a factor of three because it underestimates the charge - transfer gap in mn - doped ii - vi semiconductors . 
 fixing the nearest - neighbor coupling @xmath1 to its experimental value in gga+@xmath0 , in gga+gutzwiller , or by a simple scaling of the dft(gga ) results provides acceptable values for the exchange couplings at 2nd , 3rd , and 4th neighbor distances in cd(mn)te , zn(mn)te , zn(mn)se , and zn(mn)s . 
 in particular , we recover the experimentally observed relation @xmath2 . 
 the filling of the mn 3@xmath3-shell is not integer which puts the underlying heisenberg description into question . 
 however , using a few - ion toy model the picture of a slightly extended local moment emerges so that an integer @xmath4-shell filling is not a prerequisite for equidistant magnetization plateaus , as seen in experiment ."

"using photometry and spectroscopy of 144,609 galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey , we present bivariate distributions of pairs of seven galaxy properties : four optical colors , surface brightness , radial profile shape as measured by the srsic  index , and absolute magnitude . 
 in addition , we present the dependence of local galaxy density ( smoothed on 8 @xmath0 mpc scales ) on all of these properties . 
 several classic , well - known relations among galaxy properties are evident at extremely high signal - to - noise ratio : the color  color relations of galaxies , the color  magnitude relations , the magnitude  surface brightness relation , and the dependence of density on color and absolute magnitude . 
 we show that most of the @xmath1-band luminosity density in the universe is in the absolute magnitude and surface brightness ranges used : @xmath2 and @xmath3 in @xmath4 ( the notation @xmath5 represents the @xmath6 band shifted blueward by a factor @xmath7 ) . 
 some of the relationships between parameters , in particular the color  magnitude relations , show stronger correlations for exponential galaxies and concentrated galaxies taken separately than for all galaxies taken together . 
 we provide a simple set of fits of the dependence of galaxy properties on luminosity for these two sets of galaxies ."
"we use previously - published moderate - resolution spectra in combination with stellar atmosphere models to derive the first measured chemical abundance ratios in the leo ii dsph galaxy . 
 we find that for spectra with snr @xmath0 , we are able to measure abundances from weak ti , fe and mg lines located near the calcium infrared triplet ( cat ) . we also quantify and discuss discrepancies between the metallicities measured from fei lines and those estimated from the cat features . 
 we find that while the most metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath1 ) leo ii stars have ca and ti abundance ratios similar to those of galactic globular clusters , the more metal - rich stars show a gradual decline of ti , mg and ca abundance ratio with increasing metallicity . 
 finding these trends in this distant and apparently dynamically stable dsph galaxy supports the hypothesis that the slow chemical enrichment histories of the dsph galaxies is universal , independent of any interaction with the milky way . combining our spectroscopic abundances with published broadband photometry and updated isochrones 
 , we are able to approximate stellar ages for our bright rgb stars to a relative precision of 2 - 3 gyr . while the derived age - metallicity relationship of leo ii hints at some amount of slow enrichment , the data are still statistically consistent with no enrichment over the history of leo ii ."

"in this paper , we investigate detectability and identifiability of attacks on linear dynamical systems that are subjected to external disturbances . 
 we generalize a concept for a security index , which was previously introduced for static systems . 
 the generalized index exactly quantifies the resources necessary for targeted attacks to be undetectable and unidentifiable in the presence of disturbances . 
 this information is useful for both risk assessment and for the design of anomaly detectors . 
 finally , we show how techniques from the fault detection literature can be used to decouple disturbances and to identify attacks , under certain sparsity constraints ."
"gravitational wave astronomy has become a reality after the historical detections accomplished during the first observing run of the two advanced ligo detectors . in the following years 
 , the number of detections is expected to increase significantly with the full commissioning of the advanced ligo , advanced virgo and kagra detectors . 
 the development of sophisticated data analysis techniques to improve the opportunities of detection for low signal - to - noise - ratio events is hence a most crucial effort . 
 we present in this paper one such technique , dictionary - learning algorithms , which have been extensively developed in the last few years and successfully applied mostly in the context of image processing . 
 however , to the best of our knowledge , such algorithms have not yet been employed to denoise gravitational wave signals . by building dictionaries from numerical relativity templates of both , binary black holes mergers and bursts of rotational core collapse , 
 we show how machine - learning algorithms based on dictionaries can be also successfully applied for gravitational wave denoising . 
 we use a subset of signals from both catalogs , embedded in non - white gaussian noise , to assess our techniques with a large sample of tests and to find the best model parameters . 
 the application of our method to the actual signal gw150914 shows promising results . 
 dictionary - learning algorithms could be a complementary addition to the gravitational wave data analysis toolkit . 
 they may be used to extract signals from noise and to infer physical parameters if the data are in good enough agreement with the morphology of the dictionary atoms ."
"gas - grain and gas - phase reactions dominate the formation of molecules in the interstellar medium ( ism ) . 
 gas - grain reactions require a substrate ( e.g. a dust or ice grain ) on which the reaction is able to occur . 
 the formation of molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath0 ) in the ism is the prototypical example of a gas - grain reaction . in these reactions , 
 an atom of hydrogen will strike a surface , stick to it , and diffuse across it . 
 when it encounters another adsorbed hydrogen atom , the two can react to form molecular hydrogen and then be ejected from the surface by the energy released in the reaction . 
 we perform in - depth classical molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of hydrogen atoms interacting with an amorphous water - ice surface . 
 this study focuses on the first step in the formation process ; the sticking of the hydrogen atom to the substrate . 
 we find that careful attention must be paid in dealing with the ambiguities in defining a sticking event 
 . the technical definition of a sticking event will affect the computed sticking probabilities and coefficients . here , using our new definition of a sticking event , we report sticking probabilities and sticking coefficients for nine different incident kinetic energies of hydrogen atoms [ 5 k - 400 k ] across seven different temperatures of dust grains [ 10 k - 70 k ] . 
 we find that probabilities and coefficients vary both as a function of grain temperature and incident kinetic energy over the range of 0.99 - 0.22 ."
"isospin - violating dark matter ( ivdm ) provides a possible mechanism to ameliorate the tension among recent direct detection experiments . for ivdm 
 , we demonstrate that the results of direct detection experiments based on neutron - rich target nuclei may depend strongly on the density dependence of the symmetry energy which is presently largely unknown and controls the neutron skin thickness that reflects the relative difference of neutron and proton form factors in the neutron - rich nuclei . in particular 
 , using the neutron and proton form factors obtained from skyrme - hartree - fock calculations by varying the symmetry energy within the uncertainty region set by the latest model - independent measurement of the neutron skin thickness of @xmath0pb from prex experiment at jlab , we find that , for ivdm with neutron - to - proton coupling ratio fixed to @xmath1 , the form factor effect may enhance the sensitivity of xe - based detectors ( e.g. , xenon100 and lux ) to the dm - proton cross section by a factor of @xmath2 in the dm mass region constrained by cmds - ii(si ) and even by more than an order of magnitude for heavy dm with mass larger than @xmath3 gev , compared with the results using the empirical helm form factor . 
 our results further indicate that the form factor effect can significantly modify the recoil spectrum of xe - based detectors for heavy ivdm with @xmath1 ."

"we compute the average luminosity of x - ray flares as a function of time , for a sample of 10 long - duration gamma - ray burst afterglows . 
 the mean luminosity , averaged over a timescale longer than the duration of the individual flares , declines as a power - law in time with index @xmath0 . 
 we elaborate on the properties of the central engine that can produce such a decline . assuming that the engine is an accreting compact object , and for a standard conversion factor between accretion rate and jet luminosity , the switch between a neutrino - cooled thin disk and a non - cooled thick disk takes place at the transition from the prompt to the flaring phase . 
 we discuss the implications of this coincidence under different scenarios for the powering of the grb outflow . 
 we also show that the interaction of the outflow with the envelope of the progenitor star can not produce flares out of a continuous relativistic flow , and conclude that it is the dynamics of the disk or the jet - launching mechanism that generates an intrinsically unsteady outflow on timescales much longer than the dynamical timescale of the system . 
 this is consistent with the fact that x - ray flares are observed in short - duration grbs as well as in long - duration ones .

"the macho project has been monitoring about ten million stars in the large magellanic cloud in the search for gravitational microlensing events caused by massive compact halo objects ( machos ) in the halo of the milky way . in our standard analysis , we have searched this data set for well sampled , long duration microlensing lightcurves , detected several microlensing events consistent with machos in the @xmath0 mass range , and set limits on the abundance of objects with masses @xmath1 . in this paper , we present a different type of analysis involving the search for very short time scale brightenings of stars which is used to set strong limits on the abundance of lower mass machos . 
 our analysis of the first two years of data toward the lmc indicates that machos with masses in the range @xmath2 can not make up the entire mass of a standard spherical dark halo . combining these results with those from the standard analysis

"the optical and near - ir emission from some classes of supernovae ( sne ) , including type iin and possibly some super - luminous sne , is likely powered by a collision between the sn ejecta and dense circumstellar material ( csm ) . 
 we argue that for a range of csm masses and their radii , a collisionless shock can form , allowing for efficient cosmic - ray ( cr ) acceleration . 
 we show that @xmath0 collisions between these newly accelerated crs and the csm leads to not only gamma rays but also secondary electrons and positrons that radiate synchrotron photons in the high - frequency radio bands . 
 our estimates imply that various facilities including the jansky very large array ( vla ) and the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) may observe such sne at gpc distances by followup observations in months - to - years , although the detectability strongly depends on the csm density as well as observed frequency . 
 detecting this signal would give us a unique probe of cr acceleration at early times , and even non - detections can put interesting limits on the possibility of cr ion acceleration . 
 following our previous work , we also show that gev gamma rays can escape from the system without severe attenuation , encouraging point - source and stacking analyses with _ fermi_. we provide recipes for diagnosing interaction - powered sn scenario with multi - messenger ( neutrino and gamma - ray ) observations .

"supermassive black holes appear to be generic components of galactic nuclei . following their formation in the early universe , black holes 
 should often find themselves in bound pairs as a consequence of galaxy mergers . the greatest uncertainty in estimating the coalescence time of black hole binaries is the degree to which a binary wanders about the center of the galactic potential . 
 a simple model for binary decay is presented which qualitatively reproduces the evolution observed in the @xmath0-body simulations . 
 the model predicts binary coalescence times that are never less than several billion years . 
 mass ejection by a decaying black hole binary should substantially lower the density of its host nucleus . 
 the weak density cusps of bright ellipticals may be explained in this way if it is assumed that these galaxies formed from nearly gas - free mergers .

 we apply the procedure to current data from wmap , sdss , and the supernova searches , and obtain results that are consistent with other analyses using different combinations of data sets . 
 the effects of systematic experimental errors and variations in the analysis technique are discussed . 
 next , we use the same procedure to forecast the dark energy constraints achieveable by the end of the decade , assuming 8 years of wmap data and realistic projections for ground - based measurements of supernovae and weak lensing . 
 we find the @xmath2 constraints on the current value of @xmath0 to be @xmath3 , and on @xmath4 ( between @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) to be @xmath7 .

"we discuss the various manifestations of quantum decoherence in the forms of dephasing , entanglement with the environment , and revelation of `` which - path '' information . as a specific example , we consider an electron interference experiment . 
 the coupling of the coherent electrons to the quantized electromagnetic field illustrates all of these versions of decoherence . 
 this decoherence has two equivalent interpretations , in terms of photon emission or in terms of aharonov - bohm phase fluctuations . 
 we consider the case when the coherent electrons are coupled to photons in a squeezed vacuum state . the time - averaged result is increased decoherence . 
 however , if only electrons which are emitted during selected periods are counted , the decoherence can be suppressed below the level for the photon vacuum . 
 this is the phenomenon of _ recoherence_. 
 this effect is closely related to the quantum violations of the weak energy condition , and is restricted by similar inequalities .

"it is shown explicitly how self - similar graphs can be obtained as ` blow - up ' constructions of finite cell graphs @xmath0 . 
 this yields a larger family of graphs than the graphs obtained by discretising continuous self - similar fractals .    for a class of symmetrically self - similar graphs we study 
 the simple random walk on a cell graph @xmath0 , starting in a vertex @xmath1 of the boundary of @xmath0 . 
 it is proved that the expected number of returns to @xmath1 before hitting another vertex in the boundary coincides with the resistance scaling factor . 
 using techniques from complex rational iteration and singularity analysis for green functions we compute the asymptotic behaviour of the @xmath2-step transition probabilities of the simple random walk on the whole graph . 
 the results of grabner and woess for the sierpiski graph are generalised to the class of symmetrically self - similar graphs and at the same time the error term of the asymptotic expression is improved . 
 finally we present a criterion for the occurrence of oscillating phenomena of the @xmath2-step transition probabilities .

"we report the discovery of a quasar pair at @xmath0 separated by 21 . 
 both objects were identified as quasar candidates using simple color selection techniques applied to photometric catalogs from the cfht legacy survey ( cfhtls ) . 
 spectra obtained with the mmt present no discernible offset in redshift between the two objects ; on the other hand , there are clear differences in the emission line profiles and in the multiwavelength spectral energy distributions that strongly disfavor the hypothesis that they are gravitationally lensed images of a single quasar . 
 both quasars are surprisingly bright given their proximity ( a projected separation of @xmath1  kpc ) , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 . 
 previous measurements of the luminosity function demonstrate that luminous quasars are extremely rare at @xmath0 ; the existence of this pair suggests that quasars have strong small - scale clustering at high redshift . assuming a real - space correlation function of the form @xmath4 
 , this discovery implies a correlation length @xmath5@xmath6 , consistent with a rapid strengthening of quasar clustering at high redshift as seen in previous observations and predicted by theoretical models where feedback effects are inefficient at shutting down black hole growth at high redshift ."
"we find the green s functions for the accretion disk with the fixed outer radius and time - independent viscosity . with the green s functions , a viscous evolution of the disk with any initial conditions 
 can be described . 
 two types of the inner boundary conditions are considered : the zero stress tensor and the zero accretion rate . the variable mass inflow at the outer radius can also be included . 
 the well - known exponential decline of the accretion rate is a part of the solution with the inner zero stress tensor . 
 the solution with the zero central accretion rate is applicable to the disks around stars with the magnetosphere s boundary exceeding the corotation radius . using the solution , 
 the viscous evolution of disks in some binary systems can be studied . 
 we apply the solution with zero inner stress tensor to outbursts of short - period x - ray transients during the time around the peak . 
 it is found that for the kramers regime of opacity and the initial surface density proportional to the radius , the rise time to the peak is @xmath0 and the @xmath1-folding time of the decay is @xmath2 . 
 comparison to non - stationary @xmath3-disks shows that both models with the same value of viscosity at the outer radius produce similar behaviour on the viscous time - scale . for six bursts in x - ray novae , which exhibit fast - rise - exponential - decay and 
 are fitted by the model , we find a way to restrict the turbulent ."
"we report findings from the first set of data in a current survey to establish conclusively whether jets from young stars rotate . we observed the bi - polar jets from the t tauri stars th28 and rw aur , and the blue - shifted jet from t tauri star lkh@xmath0321 , using the hubble space telescope imaging spectrograph ( hst / stis ) . 
 forbidden emission lines ( fels ) show distinct and systematic velocity asymmetries of 10  25 ( @xmath1 5 ) km  s@xmath2 at a distance of 0@xmath3.3 from the source , representing a ( projected ) distance of @xmath4 40 au along the jet in the case of rw aur , @xmath4 50 au for th28 , and 165 au in the case of lkh@xmath0321 . 
 these velocity asymmetries are interpreted as rotation in the initial portion of the jet where it is accelerated and collimated . for the bi - polar jets , both lobes appear to rotate in the same direction . 
 values obtained were in agreement with the predictions of mhd disk - wind models @xcite .

"thermal expansion in materials can be accurately modeled with careful phonon calculations within density functional theory . however , because of interest in controlling thermal expansion and the time consumed evaluating thermal expansion properties of candidate materials , either theoretically or experimentally , an approach to rapidly identifying materials with desirable thermal expansion properties would be of great utility . 
 we show that the fraction of crystal volume occupied by ions , based upon ionic radii , the deviation of bond coordination divided by mean bond coordination , and the ratio of least to greatest atomic mass are descriptors that correlate with the coefficient of thermal expansion for a variety of materials found in widely accessible databases . 
 correlation is greatly improved by combining these descriptors in a multi - dimensional quadratic fit . 
 open space combined with a range of atomic masses and a variety of local bond coordinations indicates materials with lower coefficients of thermal expansion . 
 materials with single - valued local coordination and less open space have the highest coefficients of thermal expansion ."
"in earlier work , the abstract state machine thesis  that arbitrary algorithms are behaviorally equivalent to abstract state machines  was established for several classes of algorithms , including ordinary , interactive , small - step algorithms .

 we extend the axiomatization and , in a companion paper , the proof , to cover interactive small - step algorithms that are not necessarily ordinary . 
 this means that the algorithms ( 1 )  can complete a step without necessarily waiting for replies to all queries from that step and ( 2 )  can use not only the environment s replies but also the order in which the replies were received ."
"we study experimentally the intermittent progress of the mechanically - induced martensitic transformation in a cu - al - be single crystal through a full - field measurement technique : the grid method . 
 we utilize an in - house especially designed gravity - based device , wherein a system controlled by water pumps applies a perfectly monotonic uniaxial load through very small force increments . 
 the sample exhibits hysteretic superelastic behavior during the forward and reverse cubic - monoclinic transformation , produced by the evolution of the strain field of the phase microstructures . 
 the in - plane linear strain components are measured on the sample surface during the loading cycle , and we characterize for the first time the strain intermittency in a number of ways , showing the emergence of power - law behavior for the strain avalanching over almost six decades of magnitude . 
 we also describe the non - stationarity and the asymmetry observed in the forward vs.  the reverse transformation .

"the variation of the kinematical properties of the galactic thick disk with galactic height @xmath0 are studied by means of 412 red giants observed in the direction of the south galactic pole up to 4.5  kpc from the plane . 
 we confirm the non - null mean radial motion toward the galactic anticenter found by other authors , but we find that it changes sign at @xmath1=3  kpc , and the proposed inward motion of the lsr alone can not explain these observations . 
 the rotational velocity decreases with @xmath1 by @xmath2  km  s@xmath3  kpc@xmath3 , but the data are better represented by a power - law with index 1.25 , similar to that proposed from the analysis of sdss data . 
 all the velocity dispersions increase with @xmath1 , but the vertical gradients are small . 
 the dispersions grow proportionally , with no significant variation of the anisotropy . 
 the ratio @xmath4/@xmath5=2 suggests that the thick disk could have formed from a low - latitude merging event . 
 the vertex deviation increases with galactic height , reaching @xmath620 degrees at @xmath1=3.5  kpc . 
 the tilt angle also increases , and the orientation of the ellipsoid in the radial - vertical plane is constantly intermediate between the alignment with the cylindrical and the spherical coordinate systems . the tilt angle at @xmath1=2  kpc coincides with the expectations of mond , but an extension of the calculations to higher @xmath1 is required to perform a conclusive test .

"analysis of the properties of resonant modes in a reentrant cavity structure comprising of a post and a ring was undertaken and verified experimentally . 
 in particular we show the existence of higher order reentrant cavity modes in such a structure . 
 results show that the new cavity has two re - entrant modes , one which has a better displacement sensitivity than the single post resonator and the other with a reduced sensitivity . 
 the more sensitive mode is better than the single post resonator by a factor of 2 to 1.5 when the gap spacing is below 100 @xmath0 m .

"recently li and xia have proposed a transmission scheme for wireless relay networks based on the alamouti space time code and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing to combat the effect of timing errors at the relay nodes . 
 this transmission scheme is amazingly simple and achieves a diversity order of two for any number of relays . 
 motivated by its simplicity , this scheme is extended to a more general transmission scheme that can achieve full cooperative diversity for any number of relays . 
 the conditions on the distributed space time block code ( dstbc ) structure that admit its application in the proposed transmission scheme are identified and it is pointed out that the recently proposed full diversity four group decodable dstbcs from precoded co - ordinate interleaved orthogonal designs and extended clifford algebras satisfy these conditions . 
 it is then shown how differential encoding at the source can be combined with the proposed transmission scheme to arrive at a new transmission scheme that can achieve full cooperative diversity in asynchronous wireless relay networks with no channel information and also no timing error knowledge at the destination node .

 the correlation appears if the imaginary part of the coupling constant is nonzero , so that its observation at anticipated levels of sensitivity would reflect the presence of sources of cp violation beyond the standard model .

"stecker , malkan and scully , have shown how ongoing deep surveys of galaxy luminosity functions , spectral energy distributions and backwards evolution models of star formation rates can be used to calculate the past history of intergalactic photon densities for energies from 0.03 ev to the lyman limit at 13.6 ev and for redshifts out to 6 ( called here the intergalactic background light or ibl ) . from these calculations of the ibl at various redshifts 
 , they predict the present and past optical depth of the universe to high energy @xmath0-rays owing to interactions with photons of the ibl and the 2.7 k cmb . 
 we discuss here how this proceedure can be reversed by looking for sharp cutoffs in the spectra of extragalactic @xmath0-ray sources such as blazars at high redshifts in the multi - gev energy range with _

"we present methods for efficient characterization of an optical coherent state @xmath0 . 
 we choose measurement settings adaptively and stochastically , based on data while it is collected . 
 our algorithm divides the estimation into two distinct steps : ( i ) before the first detection of a vacuum state , the probability of choosing a measurement setting is proportional to detecting vacuum with the setting , which makes using too similar measurement settings twice unlikely ; and ( ii ) after the first detection of vacuum , we focus measurements in the region where vacuum is most likely to be detected . in step ( i ) [ ( ii ) ] the detection of vacuum ( a photon ) has a significantly larger effect on the shape of the posterior probability distribution of @xmath1 . compared to nonadaptive schemes , our method makes the number of measurement shots required to achieve a certain level of accuracy smaller approximately by a factor proportional to the area describing the initial uncertainty of @xmath1 in phase space . while this algorithm is not directly robust against readout errors , we make it such by introducing repeated measurements in step ( i ) ."
"in this work we analyse the role of low- and intermediate - mass stars in contributing to the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium . 
 first we present new sets of stellar yields basing on the results of updated evolutionary calculations , which extend from the zams up to the end of the agb phase ( girardi et al . 
 2000 ; marigo et al . 
 1999a ) . these new yields , that present a significant dependence on metallicity , 
 are then compared to those of other available sets ( renzini & voli 1981 ; van de hoek & groenewegen 1997 ) . 
 the resulting differences are explained in terms of different model assumptions 
 i.e. treatment of convective boundaries , mass loss , dredge - up , hot - bottom burning  and further discussed on the basis of important empirical constraints which should be reproduced by theory

"in this paper , we investigate the dynamical formation and evolution of @xmath0-dimensional charged black holes . 
 we numerically study dynamical collapses of charged matter fields in an anti de sitter background and note the formation of black holes using the double - null formalism . 
 moreover , we include re - normalized energy - momentum tensors assuming the @xmath1-wave approximation to determine thermodynamical back - reactions to the internal structures . 
 if there is no semi - classical effects , the amount of charge determines the causal structures . 
 if the charge is sufficiently small , the causal structure has a space - like singularity . 
 however , as the charge increases , an inner cauchy horizon appears . 
 if we have sufficient charge , we see a space - like outer horizon and a time - like inner horizon , and if we give excessive charge , black hole horizons disappear . 
 we have some circumstantial evidences that weak cosmic censorship is still satisfied , even for such excessive charge cases . also , we confirm that there is mass inflation along the inner horizon , although the properties are quite different from those of four - dimensional cases . 
 semi - classical back - reactions will not affect the outer horizon , but they will affect the inner horizon . near the center , there is a place where negative energy is concentrated . thus , charged black holes in three dimensions have two types of curvature singularities in general : via mass inflation and via a concentration of negative energy . 
 finally , we classify possible causal structures ."
"we present a geometrodynamical method for determining distances to orbital streams of hi gas in the galaxy . 
 the method makes use of our offset from the galactic centre and assumes that the gas comprising the stream nearly follows a planar orbit about the galactic centre . 
 we apply this technique to the magellanic stream and determine the distances to all points along it ; a consistency check shows that the angular momentum is approximately constant . 
 applying this technique to the large magellanic cloud itself gives an independent distance which agrees within its accuracy of around 10% . 
 relaxing the demand for exact conservation of energy and angular momentum at all points along the stream allows for an increase in orbital period between the lagging end and the front end led by the magellanic clouds . 
 similar methods are applicable to other long streams of high - velocity clouds , provided they also nearly follow planar orbits ; these would allow otherwise unknown distances to be determined .

"in this paper we extend the gaussian self  consistent method to permit study of the equilibrium and kinetics of conformational transitions for heteropolymers with any given primary sequence . 
 the kinetic equations earlier derived by us are transformed to a form containing only the mean squared distances between pairs of monomers . 
 these equations are further expressed in terms of instantaneous gradients of the variational free energy . 
 the method allowed us to study exhaustively the stability and conformational structure of some periodic and random aperiodic sequences . 
 a typical phase diagram of a fairly long amphiphilic heteropolymer chain is found to contain phases of the extended coil , the homogeneous globule , the micro 
 phase separated globule , and a large number of frustrated states , which result in conformational phases of the random coil and the frozen globule . 
 we have also found that for a certain class of sequences the frustrated phases are suppressed . 
 the kinetics of folding from the extended coil to the globule proceeds through non  equilibrium states possessing locally compacted , but partially misfolded and frustrated , structure . 
 this results in a rather complicated multistep kinetic process typical of glassy systems ."

"by making use of the langevin dynamics and its generating functional ( gf ) formulation the influence of the long - range nature of the interaction on the tendency of the glass formation is systematically investigated . in doing so two types of models

"recent experimental results have confirmed a possible reduction in the gt@xmath0 strengths of pf - shell nuclei . 
 these proton - rich nuclei are of relevance in the deflagration and explosive burning phases of type ia supernovae . 
 while prior gt strengths result in nucleosynthesis predictions with a lower - than - expected electron fraction , a reduction in the gt@xmath0 strength can result in an slightly increased electron fraction compared to previous shell model predictions , though the enhancement is not as large as previous enhancements in going from rates computed by fuller , fowler , and newman based on an independent particle model . 
 a shell model parametrization has been developed which more closely matches experimental gt strengths .

"we investigate evolutionary dynamics of two - strategy matrix games with zealots in finite populations . 
 zealots are assumed to take either strategy regardless of the fitness . 
 when the strategy selected by the zealots is the same , the fixation of the strategy selected by the zealots is a trivial outcome . 
 we study fixation time in this scenario . 
 we show that the fixation time is divided into three main regimes , in one of which the fixation time is short , and in the other two the fixation time is exponentially long in terms of the population size . 
 different from the case without zealots , there is a threshold selection intensity below which the fixation is fast for an arbitrary payoff matrix .

"we test the isotropy of the local distribution of galaxies using the 2mass extended source catalogue . by decomposing the full sky survey into distinct patches and using a combination of photometric and spectroscopic redshift data , we use both parametric and non - parametric methods to obtain the shape of the luminosity function in each patch . 
 we use the shape of the luminosity function to test the statistical isotropy of the underlying galaxy distribution . 
 the parametric estimator shows some evidence of a hemispherical asymmetry in the north / south galactic plane . 
 however the non - parametric estimator exhibits no significant anisotropy , with the galaxy distribution being consistent with the assumption of isotropy in all regions considered . 
 the parametric asymmetry is attributed to the relatively poor fit of the functional form to the underlying data .

"we theoretically study spin and charge transport induced by a twisted light beam irradiated on a disordered surface of a doped three dimensional topological insulator ( ti ) . 
 we find that various types of spin vortices are imprinted on the surface of the ti depending on the spin and orbital angular momentum of the incident light . 
 the key mechanism for the appearance of the unconventional spin structure is the spin - momentum locking in the surface state of the ti . 
 besides , the diffusive transport of electrons under an inhomogeneous electric field causes a gradient of the charge density , which then induces nonlocal charge current and spin density as well as the spin current . 
 we discuss the relation between these quantities within the linear response to the applied electric field using the keldysh - green s function method .

"feedback control of quantum systems via continuous measurement involves complex nonlinear dynamics . except in very special cases , even for a single qubit optimal feedback protocols are unknown . 
 not even do intuitive candidates exist for choosing the measurement basis , which is the primary non - trivial ingredient in the feedback control of a qubit . here 
 we present a series of arguments that suggest a particular form for the optimal protocol for a broad class of noise sources in the regime of good control . 
 this regime is defined as that in which the control is strong enough to keep the system close to the desired state . with the assumption of this form 
 the remaining parameters can be determined via a numerical search . 
 the result is a non - trivial feedback protocol valid for all feedback strengths in the regime of good control .

"we propose the possibility of a new phenomenon affecting the settling of dust grains at the terrestrial region in early protoplanetary disks . 
 sinking dust grains evaporate in a hot inner region during an early stage of disk evolution , and the effects of condensation and evaporation on vertical dust settling can be significant . 
 a 1-d dust settling model considering both physical and chemical aspects is presented in this paper . 
 modeling results show that dust grains evaporate as they sink into the hotter interior and form a `` condensation front '' above which dust - composing elements , mg , si , and fe , accumulate , creating a large temperature jump . repeating evaporation at the front inhibits grain growth , resulting in slow settling with a time scale comparable to that of radial evolution . 
 the time scale of dust settling is predicted to be longer than 10@xmath0 years at 1  au , whereas an order of 10@xmath1 years is suggested by the standard theory of planetary formation . 
 the new model might also explain some puzzling compositional features observed in chondrites . 
 our results show different settling behaviors between highly refractory elements , such as al and ca , and moderately refractory elements , such as mg , si , and fe , pointing to the importance of building a more complete model that takes into account both the physical and chemical evolution of protoplanetary disks ."
"we present time - resolved spectroscopy and photometry of the dwarf nova sbss1108 + 574 , obtained during the 2012 outburst . 
 its quiescent spectrum is unusually rich in helium , showing broad , double - peaked emission lines from the accretion disc . 
 we measure a line flux ratio hei  5875/h@xmath0=0.81@xmath10.04 , a much higher ratio than typically observed in cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) . 
 the outburst spectrum shows hydrogen and helium in absorption , with weak emission of h@xmath0 and hei  6678 , as well as strong heii emission .    from our photometry 
 , we find the superhump period to be 56.34@xmath10.18minutes , in agreement with the previously published result . 
 the spectroscopic period , derived from the radial velocities of the emission lines , is found to be 55.3@xmath10.8minutes , consistent with a previously identified photometric orbital period , and significantly below the normal cv period minimum . 
 this indicates that the donor in sbss1108 + 574 is highly evolved . 
 the superhump excess derived from our photometry implies a mass ratio of @xmath2=0.086@xmath10.014 . 
 our spectroscopy reveals a grazing eclipse of the large outbursting disc . 
 as the disc is significantly larger during outburst , it is unlikely that an eclipse will be detectable in quiescence . 
 the relatively high accretion rate implied by the detection of outbursts , together with the large mass ratio , suggests that sbss1108 + 574 is still evolving towards its period minimum .

"peptide nucleic acids ( pna ) are non - natural oligonucleotides mimics , wherein the phosphoribose backbone has been replaced by a peptidic moiety ( n-(2-aminoethyl)glycine ) . 
 this peptidic backbone lends itself to substitution and the @xmath0-position has proven to yield oligomers with enhanced hybridization properties . in this study , we use nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and circular dichroism ( cd ) to explore the properties of the supramolecular duplexes formed by these species . 
 we show that standard watson - crick base pair as well as non - standard ones are formed in solution . 
 the duplexes thus formed present marked melting transition temperatures substantially higher than their nucleic acid homologs . 
 moreover , the presence of a chiral group on the @xmath0-peptidic backbone increases further this transition temperature , leading to very stable duplexes . 
 pna duplexes with a chiral backbone present a marked chiral secondary structure , observed by cd , and showing a common folding pattern for all studied structures . nevertheless small differences are observed depending on the details of the nucleobase sequence .

"the dynamic shape relaxation of the two - layer - vesicle is calculated . in additional to the undulation relaxation where the two bilayers move in the same direction , the squeezing mode appears when the gap between the two bilayers is small . at large gap , the inner vesicle relaxes much faster , whereas the slow mode is mainly due to the outer layer relaxation . 
 we have calculated the viscoelasticity of the dilute two - layer - vesicle suspension . 
 it is found that for small gap , the applied shear drives the undulation mode strongly while the slow squeezing mode is not much excited . in this limit 
 the complex viscosity is dominated by the fast mode contribution . on the other hand , the slow mode 
 is strongly driven by shear for larger gap . 
 we have determined the crossover gap which depends on the interaction between the two bilayers . for a series of samples where the gap is changed systematically

"distant regions close to the plane of our galaxy are largely unexplored by optical surveys as they are hidden by dust . 
 we have used near - infrared data ( that minimizes dust obscuration ) from the eso public survey vista variables of the via lactea ( vvv ) ( minniti et al . 
 2011 ; saito et al . 
 2012 ; henceforth s12 ) to search for distant stars at low latitudes . 
 we have discovered four cepheid variables within an angular extent of one degree centered at galactic longitude of @xmath0 and galactic latitude of @xmath1 . 
 we use the tightly constrained period - luminosity relationship that these pulsating stars obey ( persson et al . 2004 ; matsunaga et al . 2011 ) to derive distances . 
 we infer an average distance to these cepheid variables of 90 kpc . 
 the cepheid variables are highly clustered in angle ( within one degree ) and in distance ( the standard deviation of the distances is 12 kpc ) . 
 they are at an average distance of @xmath2 from the plane and their maximum projected separation is @xmath3 . 
 these young ( @xmath4 100 myr old ) , pulsating stars ( bono et al .

"the galactic x - ray transient xte  j1752@xmath0223 was shown to have properties of black hole binary candidates . as reported in our previous paper , we identified transient and decelerating ejecta in multi - epoch very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations with the european vlbi network ( evn ) and the nrao very long baseline array ( vlba ) . here 
 we present new evn and vlba data in which a new transient ejection event and later a stationary component are identified . 
 the latter is interpreted as a reappearance of the radio core / compact jet during the transition from soft to hard x - ray state . 
 this component appears to be highly variable in brightness although effects of tropospheric instabilities might play a role too . 
 we also re - analyze the earlier vlbi data and find that the transient ejecta closer to the core position has significantly higher proper motion , further strengthening the case for strongly decelerating ejecta on the scale of several hundred milli - arcsecond , never observed in x - ray binaries before . 
 although the distance of the source is not well constrained , it is clear that these ejectas are at least mildly relativistic at the early stages .

 we focus on the qws with chiral symmetry in a topological phase , and reveal that chiral symmetry together with bipartite nature of the qws brings about intriguing behaviors such as coexistence of topologically protected edge states at zero energy and anderson transitions in the 1d chiral class at _ non - zero _ energy in their dynamics . 
 contrary to the previous studies , therefore , the spatially disordered qws can avoid complete localization due to the anderson transition .

"the genotype - fitness map plays a fundamental role in shaping the dynamics of evolution . 
 however , it is difficult to directly measure a fitness landscape in practice , because the number of possible genotypes is astronomical . 
 one approach is to sample as many genotypes as possible , measure their fitnesses , and fit a statistical model of the landscape that includes additive and pairwise interactive effects between loci . 
 here we elucidate the pitfalls of using such regressions , by studying artificial but mathematically convenient fitness landscapes . 
 we identify two sources of bias inherent in these regression procedures that each tends to under - estimate high fitnesses and over - estimate low fitnesses . 
 we characterize these biases for random sampling of genotypes , as well as for samples drawn from a population under selection in the wright - fisher model of evolutionary dynamics . 
 we show that common measures of epistasis , such as the number of monotonically increasing paths between ancestral and derived genotypes , the prevalence of sign epistasis , and the number of local fitness maxima , are distorted in the inferred landscape . as a result 
 , the inferred landscape will provide systematically biased predictions for the dynamics of adaptation . 
 we identify the same biases in a computational rna - folding landscape , as well as in regulatory sequence binding data , treated with the same fitting procedure .

 the formula reproduces quite well the mass functions of simulated haloes in models with quintessence . 
 we use the cluster mass function data at a number of redshifts from carlberg et al . to constrain @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath1 . 
 the best fit is obtained in the limit @xmath7 , but none of the values of @xmath1 in the considered range @xmath8 can actually be excluded .

 since less negative @xmath1 push the confidence regions toward higher @xmath5 and lower @xmath6 we conclude that relaxing the assumption of @xmath2 typically made in such comparisons may resolve the discrepancy between recent cluster mass function results ( yielding rather low @xmath5 and high @xmath6 ) and most other estimates .

 we explore consequences of the drop bistability for the dynamics of highly viscous drops . 
 using both boundary - integral simulations and small - deformation theory we show that a quasi - static change of the flow vorticity gives rise to a hysteretic response of the drop shape , with rapid changes between the compact and elongated solutions at critical values of the vorticity . in flows with sinusoidal temporal variation of the vorticity we find chaotic drop dynamics in response to the periodic forcing .

"among the most spectacular variable stars are the luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) , which can show three types of variability . the lbv phase of evolution is poorly understood , and the driving mechanisms for the variability are not known . the most common type of variability , the s dor instability , occurs on timescales of tens of years 
 during an s dor outburst , the visual magnitude of the star increases , while the bolometric magnitude stays approximately constant . in this work , we investigate pulsation as a possible trigger for the s dor type outbursts . 
 we calculate the pulsations of envelope models using a nonlinear hydrodynamics code including a time - dependent convection treatment . 
 we initialize the pulsation in the hydrodynamic model based on linear non - adiabatic calculations . 
 pulsation properties for a full grid of models from 20 to 85 m@xmath0were calculated , and in this paper we focus on the few models that show either long - period pulsations or outburst - like behaviour , with photospheric radial velocities reaching 70 - 80 km / s . at the present time , our models can not follow mass loss , so once the outburst event begins , our simulations are terminated . 
 our results show that pulsations alone are not able to drive enough surface expansion to eject the outer layers 
 . however , the outbursts and long - period pulsations discussed here produce large variations in effective temperature and luminosity , which are expected to produce large variations in the radiatively driven mass - loss rates .

"giant radio haloes in galaxy clusters are the primary evidence for the existence of relativistic particles ( cosmic rays ) and magnetic fields over mpc scales . 
 observational tests for the different theoretical models explaining their powering mechanism have so far been obtained through x - ray selection of clusters , e.g. by comparing cluster x - ray luminosities with radio halo power . here 
 we present the first global scaling relations between radio halo power and integrated sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect measurements , using the _ planck _ all - sky cluster catalog and published radio data . 
 the correlation agrees well with previous scaling measurements based on x - ray data , and offers a more direct probe into the mass dependence inside radio haloes . 
 however , we find no strong indication for a bi - modal cluster population split between radio halo and radio quiet objects . we discuss the possible causes for this apparent lack of bi - modality , and compare the observed slope of the radio - sz correlation with competing theoretical models of radio halo origin .

"we review the derivation of the metric for a spinning body of any shape and composition using linearized general relativity theory , and also obtain the same metric using a transformation argument . 
 the latter derivation makes it clear that the linearized metric contains only the eddington @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters , so no new parameter is involved in frame  dragging or lense  thirring effects . 
 we then calculate the precession of an orbiting gyroscope in a general weak gravitational field , described by a newtonian potential ( the gravito - electric field ) and a vector potential ( the gravito - magnetic field ) . 
 next we make a multipole analysis of the potentials and the precession equations , giving all of these in terms of the spherical harmonics moments of the density distribution . the analysis is not limited to an axially symmetric source , 
 although the earth , which is the main application , is very nearly axisymmetric 
 . finally we analyze the precession in regard to the gravity probe b ( gp - b ) experiment , and find that the effect of the earth s quadrupole moment ( @xmath2 ) on the geodetic precession is large enough to be measured by gp - b ( a previously known result ) , but the effect on the lense  thirring precession is somewhat beyond the expected gp - b accuracy ."
"the effects of passive scalar anisotropy on subgrid - scale ( sgs ) physics and modeling for large - eddy simulations are studied experimentally . 
 measurements are performed across a moderate reynolds number wake flow generated by a heated cylinder , using an array of four x - wire and four cold - wire probes . by varying the separation distance among probes in the array , we obtain filtered and subgrid quantities at three different filter sizes . 
 we compute several terms that comprise the subgrid dissipation tensor of kinetic energy and scalar - variance and test for isotropic behavior , as a function of filter scale . 
 we find that whereas the kinetic energy dissipation tensor tends towards isotropy at small scales , the sgs scalar - variance dissipation remains anisotropic independent of filter scale . 
 the eddy - diffusion model predicts isotropic behavior , whereas the nonlinear ( or tensor eddy diffusivity ) model reproduces the correct trends , but overestimates the level of scalar dissipation anisotropy . 
 these results provide some support for so - called mixed models but raise new questions about the causes of the observed anisotropy ."

"evidence from numerical simulations suggest that the nature of dynamo transition changes from supercritical to subcritical as the magnetic prandtl number is decreased . to explore this interesting crossover 
 we first use direct numerical simulations to investigate the hysteresis zone of a subcritical taylor - green dynamo .

 we then propose simple dynamo models which show similar crossover from supercritical to subcritical dynamo transition as a function of the magnetic prandtl number . 
 our models show that the change in the nature of dynamo transition is connected to the stabilizing or de - stabilizing influence of governing non - linearities ."

"we analyze qcd and weinberg - type sum rules in a low - temperature pion gas using vector and axial - vector spectral functions following from the model - independent chiral - mixing scheme . toward this end 
 we employ recently constructed vacuum spectral functions with ground and first - excited states in both channels and a universal perturbative continuum ; they quantitatively describe hadronic @xmath0-decay data and satisfy vacuum sum rules . 
 these features facilitate the implementation of chiral mixing without further assumptions , and lead to in - medium spectral functions which exhibit a mutual tendency of compensating resonance and dip structures , suggestive for an approach toward structureless distributions . in the sum rule analysis 
 , we account for pion mass corrections , which turn out to be significant .

 @xmath2 represents a volume term and @xmath3 a surface tension term . 
 these values are taken from nuclear physics .

"if susy provides a solution to the hierarchy problem then supersymmetric states should not be too heavy . 
 this requirement is quantified by a fine tuning measure that provides a quantitative test of susy as a solution to the hierarchy problem . 
 the measure is useful in correlating the impact of the various experimental measurements relevant to the search for supersymmetry and also in identifying the most sensitive measurements for testing susy . in this paper 
 we apply the measure to the cmssm , computing it to two - loop order and taking account of current experimental limits and the constraint on dark matter abundance . using this 
 we determine the present limits on the cmssm parameter space and identify the measurements at the lhc that are most significant in covering the remaining parameter space . without imposing the lep higgs mass bound we show that the smallest fine tuning ( 1:13 ) consistent with a relic density within the wmap bound corresponds to a higgs mass of 114@xmath02 gev .

"we present a general formulation of special - relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and derive exact radially self - similar solutions for axisymmetric outflows from strongly magnetized , rotating compact objects . 
 we generalize previous work by including thermal effects and analyze in detail the various forces that guide , accelerate , and collimate the flow . 
 we demonstrate that , under the assumptions of a quasi - steady poloidal magnetic field and of a highly relativistic poloidal velocity , the equations become effectively time - independent and the motion can be described as a frozen pulse . 
 we concentrate on trans - alfvnic solutions and consider outflows that are super - alfvnic throughout in the companion paper . 
 our results are applicable to relativistic jets in gamma - ray burst ( grb ) sources , active galactic nuclei , and microquasars , but our discussion focuses on grbs . 
 we envision the outflows in this case to initially consist of a hot and optically thick mixture of baryons , electron - positron pairs , and photons . 
 we show that the flow is at first accelerated thermally but that the bulk of the acceleration is magnetic , with the asymptotic lorentz factor corresponding to a rough equipartition between the poynting and kinetic - energy fluxes ( i.e. , @xmath0 of the injected total energy is converted into baryonic kinetic energy ) .

"we apply a simple statistical method ( derenzo & hildebrand 1969 ) to estimating the completeness of quasar surveys . 
 it requires that an area has been covered by two or more , preferably different , selection techniques . 
 we use three suitable data sets with separate selections from : variability and uv - excess ( 170 quasars ) ; objective prism and uv - excess ( 141 quasars ) ; multicolour and x - ray ( _ rosat , _ 19 quasars ) . 
 we find that , for selection by uv - excess , the common limit of @xmath0 leads to losses of @xmath1 , typically missing low - luminosity @xmath2 quasars , independently of redshift . 
 systematic incompleteness will therefore affect the new generation of large quasar surveys that select by @xmath3 . by correcting for this incompleteness 
 , we find , from the first data set ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , that the evolution of the quasar luminosity function ( lf ) is best described by joint luminosity and density evolution . 
 when extrapolated to @xmath6 , the lf matches that of local seyfert galaxies better than any previous determination . 
 the lf shows an increase in the number of low - luminosity quasars at low redshifts and of brighter quasars at intermediate redshifts , relative to the lf of boyle et al .

 this result is consistent with models in which quasars fade from an initial bright phase .

"we propose a stochastic dynamic model of migration and economic aggregation in a system of employed ( immobile ) and unemployed ( mobile ) agents which respond to local wage gradients . 
 dependent on the local economic situation , described by a production function which includes cooperative effects , employed agents can become unemployed and vice versa . 
 the spatio - temporal distribution of employed and unemployed agents is investigated both analytically and by means of stochastic computer simulations . 
 we find the establishment of distinct economic centers out of a random initial distribution . 
 the evolution of these centers occurs in two different stages : ( i ) small economic centers are formed based on the positive feedback of mutual stimulation / cooperation among the agents , ( ii ) some of the small centers grow at the expense of others , which finally leads to the concentration of the labor force in different extended economic regions . this crossover to large - scale production is accompanied by an increase in the unemployment rate .

"the electronic structure of diluted ( ga , mn)as magnetic semiconductors in the presence of as - antisites and magnetic disorder is studied within the framework of the local spin density approximation . 
 both the chemical and magnetic disorders are treated using the coherent potential approximation . 
 a ground state with partial disorder in the local moments and with a reduced total magnetic moment appears in the presence of as - antisites . 
 we first estimate the curie temperature @xmath0 from total energy differences between the ferromagnetic and the paramagnetic state by identifying these with the corresponding energy difference in a classical heisenberg model . 
 a more systematic approach within the framework of the mean - field approximation to estimate @xmath0 consists in an evaluation of the effective exchange fields acting on the magnetic moment at a given site . 
 the presence of as - antisites strongly reduces the curie temperature . 
 the results indicate that the effect of impurities on the electronic structure can not be neglected and influences the curie temperature non - negligibly . 
 a comparison of the calculated curie temperatures to existing experimental data indicates an increase of the donor concentration with the increase of the mn - content ."
"the current paradigm foresees that relativistic jets are launched as magnetically dominated flows , whose magnetic power is progressively converted to kinetic power of of the matter of the jet , until equipartition is reached . 
 therefore , at the end of the acceleration phase , the jet should still carry a substantial fraction ( @xmath0 half ) of its power in the form of a poynting flux . 
 it has been also argued that , in these conditions , the best candidate particle acceleration mechanism is efficient reconnection of magnetic field lines , for which it is predicted that magnetic field and accelerated relativistic electron energy densities are in equipartition . through the modeling of the jet 
 non  thermal emission , we explore if equipartition is indeed possible in bl lac objects , i.e. low  power blazars with weak or absent broad emission lines . 
 we find that one  zone models ( for which only one region is involved in the production of the radiation we observe ) the particle energy density is largely dominating ( by 12 orders of magnitude ) over the magnetic one . as a consequence , 
 the jet kinetic power largely exceeds the magnetic power . 
 instead , if the jet is structured ( i.e. made by a fast spine surrounded by a slower layer ) , the amplification of the ic emission due to the radiative interplay between the two components allows us to reproduce the emission in equipartition conditions .

"a first adiabatic core is a transient object formed in the early phase of star formation . 
 the observation of a first core is believed to be difficult because of its short lifetime and low luminosity . on the basis of radiation hydrodynamic simulations , 
 we propose a novel theoretical model of first cores , exposed long - lifetime first core ( elf ) . in the very low - mass molecular core 
 , the first core evolves slowly and lives longer than 10,000 years because the accretion rate is considerably low . 
 the evolution of elfs is different from that of ordinary first cores because radiation cooling has a significant effect there . 
 we also carry out radiation transfer calculation of dust - continuum emission from elfs to predict their observational properties . 
 elfs have slightly fainter but similar seds to ordinary first cores in radio wavelengths , therefore they can be observed . 
 although the probabilities that such low mass cores become gravitationally unstable and start to collapse are low , we still can expect that a considerable number of elfs can be formed because there are many low - mass molecular cloud cores in star - forming regions that can be progenitors of elfs ."
"linear receivers are often used to reduce the implementation complexity of multiple antenna systems . in a traditional linear receiver architecture , 
 the receive antennas are used to separate out the codewords sent by each transmit antenna , which can then be decoded individually . 
 although easy to implement , this approach can be highly sub - optimal when the channel matrix is near singular . 
 this paper develops a new linear receiver architecture that uses the receive antennas to create an effective channel matrix with integer - valued entries . rather than attempting to recover transmitted codewords 
 directly , the decoder recovers integer combinations of the codewords according to the entries of the effective channel matrix . 
 the codewords are all generated using the same linear code which guarantees that these integer combinations are themselves codewords . 
 if the effective channel is full rank , these integer combinations can then be digitally solved for the original codewords . 
 this paper focuses on the special case where there is no coding across transmit antennas . in this setting , 
 the integer - forcing linear receiver significantly outperforms traditional linear architectures such as the decorrelator and mmse receiver . in the high snr regime 
 , the proposed receiver attains the optimal diversity - multiplexing tradeoff for the standard mimo channel . 
 it is further shown that in an extended mimo model with interference , the integer - forcing linear receiver achieves the optimal generalized degrees - of - freedom .

"the study of stellar oscillations - asteroseismology - has revolutionized our understanding of the physical properties of the sun and similar potential for other stars has been demonstrated in recent years . in particular 
 , asteroseismic studies can constrain the stellar size , temperature and composition , which are important parameters to our understanding of planetary structure and evolution . 
 this makes asteroseismology a very powerful tool to complement planetary transits . as an example 
 , the transit measurement alone does not give the radius of the planet unless the radius of the host star is known , which again requires a known distance to the system . 
 transit measurements will therefore often require additional measurements to establish the radius of the planet . 
 with asteroseismology we can determine the radius of a star to very high precision ( 23% ) using only the photometric transit measurements . 
 this will be very valuable for a mission such as kepler , which will produce photometric time series of very high quality ."

"we study the collective excitations of a neutral atomic bose - einstein condensate with gravity - like @xmath0 interatomic attraction induced by electromagnetic wave . using the time - dependent variational approach 
 , we derive an analytical spectrum for monopole and quadrupole mode frequencies of a gravity - like self - bound bose condensed state at zero temperature . 
 we also analyze the excitation frequencies of the thomas - fermi - gravity ( tf - g ) and gravity ( g ) regimes . 
 our result agrees excellently with that of giovanazzi _

 we also consider the vortex state . 
 we estimate the superfluid coherence length and the critical angular frequencies to create a vortex around the @xmath1-axis . 
 we find that the tf - g regime can exhibit the superfluid properties more prominently than the g - regime . 
 we find that the monopole mode frequency of the condensate decreases due to the presence of a vortex ."

 they are accompanied by weak red noise or zero - centered lorentzian components with @xmath2 variability at the @xmath5 level . 
 the energy spectra consists of three varying components  multicolour disk blackbody ( @xmath6 ) , high energy power - law tail ( @xmath7 ) and a broad iron line at @xmath8 . the broad iron line , the qpo and the strong power - law component are not always present . the qpos and the broad iron line appear to be clearly detected in the presence of a strong power - law component . 
 the broad iron line is found to be weaker when the disk is likely truncated and absent when the power - law component almost vanished . 
 these results suggest that the qpo and the broad iron line together can be used to probe the dynamics of the accretion disk and the corona .

"the ams-02 experiment confirms the excess of positrons in cosmic rays ( crs ) for energy above 10 gev with respect to the secondary production of positrons in the interstellar medium . 
 this is interpreted as evidence of the existence of a primary source of these particles . 
 possible candidates are dark matter or astrophysical sources . in this work 
 we discuss the possible contribution due to pulsars and their nebulae . 
 our key assumption is that the primary spectrum of electrons and positrons at the source is the same of the well known photon spectrum observed from gamma - rays telescopes . using a diffusion model in the galaxy we propagate the source spectra up to the solar system .

"relativistic mean - field theory with @xmath0 meson , nonlinear isoscalar self - interactions and isoscalar - isovector cross interaction terms with parametrizations obtained to reproduce dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock calculations for nuclear matter is used to study asymmetric nuclear matter properties in @xmath1-equilibrium , including hyperon degrees of freedom and ( hidden ) strange mesons . 
 influence of cross interaction on composition of hyperon matter and electron chemical potential is examined . 
 softening of nuclear equation of state by the cross interactions results in lowering of hyperonization , although simultaneously enhancing a hyperon - induced decrease of the electron chemical potential , thus indicating further shift of a kaon condensate occurence to higher densities ."
"we define thermodynamic configurations and identify two primitives of discrete quantum processes between configurations for which heat and work can be defined in a natural way . 
 this allows us to uncover a general second law for any discrete trajectory that consists of a sequence of these primitives , linking both equilibrium and non - equilibrium configurations . 
 moreover , in the limit of a discrete trajectory that passes through an infinite number of configurations , i.e. in the reversible limit , we recover the saturation of the second law . 
 finally , we show that for a discrete carnot cycle operating between four configurations one recovers carnot s thermal efficiency ."
"to show the feasibility of a long distance partial bell - state measurement , a hong - ou - mandel experiment with coherent photons is reported . 
 pairs of degenerate photons at telecom wavelength are created by parametric down conversion in a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide . 
 the photon pairs are separated in a beam - splitter and transmitted via two fibers of 25 km . 
 the wave - packets are relatively delayed and recombined on a second beam - splitter , forming a large mach - zehnder interferometer . 
 coincidence counts between the photons at the two output modes are registered . 
 the main challenge consists in the trade - off between low count rates due to narrow filtering and length fluctuations of the 25 km long arms during the measurement . for balanced paths a hong - ou - mandel dip with a net visibility of 47.3 % 
 is observed , which is close to the maximal theoretical value of 50% developed here . 
 this proves the practicability of a long distance bell state measurement with two independent sources , as e.g. required in an entanglement swapping configuration in the scale of tens of km ."
"we numerically study dynamical behaviors of the quasiperiodically forced hodgkin - huxley neuron and compare the dynamical responses with those for the case of periodic stimulus . in the periodically forced case , 
 a transition from a periodic to a chaotic oscillation was found to occur via period doublings in previous numerical and experimental works . 
 we investigate the effect of the quasiperiodic forcing on this period - doubling route to chaotic oscillation . 
 in contrast to the case of periodic forcing , new type of strange nonchaotic ( sn ) oscillating states ( that are geometrically strange but have no positive lyapunov exponents ) are found to exist between the regular and chaotic oscillating states as intermediate ones . 
 their strange fractal geometry leads to aperiodic `` complex '' spikings . 
 various dynamical routes to sn oscillations are identified , as in the quasiperiodically forced logistic map . 
 these sn spikings are expected to be observed in experiments of the quasiperiodically forced squid giant axon ."
"consider the problem of a multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) multiple - access channel ( mac ) at the limit of large number of users . clearly , in practical scenarios , only a small subset of the users can be scheduled to utilize the channel simultaneously . 
 thus , a problem of user selection arises . 
 however , since solutions which collect channel state information ( csi ) from all users and decide on the best subset to transmit in each slot do not scale when the number of users is large , distributed algorithms for user selection are advantageous .    in this paper , we suggest a distributed user selection algorithm , which selects a group of users to transmit without coordinating between all users and without all users sending csi to the base station . 
 this threshold - based algorithm is analyzed for both zero - forcing ( zf ) and minimal mean square error ( mmse ) receivers , and its expected capacity in the limit of large number of users is investigated . 
 it is shown that for large number of users it achieves the same scaling laws as the optimal centralized scheme . 
 multi - stage distributed schemes are also considered and shown to be advantageous in practical scenarios .

"using first - principle plane wave method we investigate the effects of static charging on structural , electronic and magnetic properties of suspended , single layer graphene , graphane , fluorographene , bn and mos@xmath0 in honeycomb structure . 
 the limitations of periodic boundary conditions in the treatment of negatively charged layers are clarified . upon positive charging the band gaps between the conduction and valence bands increase , but the single layer nanostructures become metallic owing to the fermi level dipping below the maximum of valence band . moreover , their bond lengths increase leading to phonon softening . as a result , the frequencies of raman active modes are lowered . 
 high level of positive charging leads to structural instabilities in single layer nanostructures , since their specific phonon modes attain imaginary frequencies . 
 similarly , excess positive charge is accumulated at the outermost layers of metallized bn and mos@xmath0 sheets comprising a few layers . 
 once the charging exceeds a threshold value the outermost layers are exfoliated . 
 charge relocation and repulsive force generation are in compliance with classical theories ."
"we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the tracer diffusion in a sea of polymers with specific binding zones for the tracer . these binding zones act as traps . 
 our simulations show that the tracer can undergo normal yet non - gaussian diffusion under certain circumstances , e.g , when the polymers with traps are frozen in space and the volume fraction and the binding strength of the traps are moderate . in this case , as the tracer moves , it experiences a heterogeneous environment and exhibits confined continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) like motion resulting a non - gaussian behavior . 
 also the long time dynamics becomes subdiffusive as the number or the binding strength of the traps increases . 
 however , if the polymers are mobile then the tracer dynamics is gaussian but could be normal or subdiffusive depending on the number and the binding strength of the traps . 
 in addition , with increasing binding strength and the number of the polymer traps , the probability of the tracer being trapped increases . on the other hand , removing the binding zones does not result trapping , even at comparatively high crowding . 
 our simulations also show that the trapping probability increases with the increasing size of the tracer and for a bigger tracer with the frozen polymer background the dynamics is only weakly non - gaussian but highly subdiffusive . 
 our observations are in the same spirit as found in many recent experiments on tracer diffusion in polymeric materials and questions the validity of gaussian theory to describe diffusion in crowded environment in general ."
"the nondetection of neutrinos coming from gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) by the icecube experiment has raised serious questions on our understanding of grb s and the mechanism of neutrino flux production in them . 
 motivated by this and the need for a precise calculation for grb neutrino flux , here we study the effects of beyond standard model physics on the grb neutrino flux . in the internal shock model of grb , high energy neutrinos are expected from muon , pion and kaon decays . using the latest best fit neutrino oscillation parameters , we compute the expected flux on earth for standard as well as non - standard oscillation scenarios . among the non - standard scenarios , we consider neutrino decay , pseudo - dirac nature of neutrinos and presence of one ev scale light sterile neutrino . incorporating other experimental bounds on these new physics scenarios , 
 we show that neutrino decay scenario can significantly alter the neutrino flux on earth from the expected ones whereas the corresponding changes for pseudo - dirac and sterile neutrino cases are moderate ."
"a tendency for the axes of double - lobed radio quasars to be aligned with the electric vectors of optical polarization in the active galactic nuclei is well - known . 
 however , the origin of the polarization and reason behind its correlation with radio morphology is not yet established . from accurate spectropolarimetry of 7 quasars which show this alignment effect , we find that the polarization is universally confined to the continuum , and not shared by the line emission or 3000    bump . over the observed region 
 @xmath0   , the spectral indices of polarized flux , @xmath1 , are consistent with uniform polarization applied to the light of the big blue bump or with synchrotron emission . 
 however , electron scattering from an optically - thick , geometrically - thin , accretion disk is well - known to give rise to a polarization position angle that is perpendicular to the disk axis . 
 optical synchrotron emission akin to that shown to exist in the miniblazar 3c  273 is a more attractive explanation , and supporting evidence can be found for some of the targets in the form of polarimetric variability over intervals of years . 
 properties of the most strongly - polarized radio - optical aligned quasars can be explained by misdirected blazar core components that have net polarizations of @xmath2% and provide @xmath310% of the total optical light ."
"we report on a multiwavelength survey of a sample of 42 flat - spectrum radio - loud narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( rlnls1s ) . 
 this is the largest known sample of this type of active galactic nucleus ( agn ) to date . 
 we found that 17% of sources were detected at high - energy gamma rays ( @xmath0  mev ) , and 90% at x - rays ( @xmath1  kev ) . 
 the masses of the central black holes are in the range @xmath2 , smaller than the values of blazars . 
 the disk luminosities are about @xmath3% of the eddington value , with one outlier at 0.3% , comparable with the luminosities observed in flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) . the jet powers are @xmath4  erg  s@xmath5 , comparable with bl lac objects , yet relatively smaller than fsrqs . however , once renormalized by the mass of the central black hole , the jet powers of rlnls1s , bl lacs , and fsrqs are consistent each other , indicating the scalability of the jets . 
 we found episodes of extreme variability at high energies on time scales of hours . in some cases , 
 dramatic spectral and flux changes are interpreted as the interplay between the relativistic jet and the accretion disk . 
 we conclude that , despite the distinct observational properties , the central engines of rlnls1s are similar to those of blazars .    1.0 cm"
"we report on our investigation of the crystal structure of arsenic under compression , focusing primarily on the pressure - induced a7  @xmath0  simple cubic ( sc ) phase transition . 
 the two - atom rhombohedral unit cell is subjected to pressures ranging from 0  gpa to 200  gpa ; for each given pressure , cell lengths and angles , as well as atomic positions , are allowed to vary until the fully relaxed structure is obtained . 
 we find that the nearest and next - nearest neighbor distances give the clearest indication of the occurrence of a structural phase transition . 
 calculations are performed using the local density approximation ( lda ) and the pbe and pw91 generalized gradient approximations ( gga - pbe and gga - pw91 ) for the exchange - correlation functional .

"we investigate the imprint of reheating on the gravitational wave spectrum produced by self - ordering of multi - component scalar fields after a global phase transition . 
 the equation of state of the universe during reheating , which usually has different behaviour from that of a radiation - dominated universe , affects the evolution of gravitational waves through the hubble expansion term in the equations of motion . 
 this gives rise to a different power - law behavior of frequency in the gravitational wave spectrum . 
 the reheating history is therefore imprinted in the shape of the spectrum . 
 we perform @xmath0 lattice simulations to investigate how the ordering scalar field reacts to the change of the hubble expansion and how the reheating effect arises in the spectrum . 
 we also compare the result with inflation - produced gravitational waves , which has a similar spectral shape , and discuss whether it is possible to distinguish the origin between inflation and global phase transition by detecting the shape with future direct detection gravitational wave experiments such as decigo ."

 the clusters are formed typically according to the economical and geographical factors . 
 we also study topology of weighted minimal spanning trees for different network representations ( i.e. , for different base currencies ) and find that in a majority of representations the network has a hierarchical scale - free structure . 
 in addition , we analyze the temporal evolution of the network and detect that its structure is not stable over time . 
 a medium - term trend can be identified which affects the usd node by decreasing its centrality .

 in addition , we present new results regarding the supernova remnant cta  1 .

 the investigation includes the isotopes of barium from the valley of stability to exotic proton - rich region . 
 the ground as well as neck configurations for these nuclei are generated from their total nucleonic density distributions of the corresponding state . 
 we have estimated the constituents ( number of nucleons ) in the elongated neck region of the fission state .

"we develop a model for visible matter - dark matter interaction based on the exchange of a massive gray boson called herein the mulato . 
 our model hinges on the assumption that all known particles in the visible matter have their counterparts in the dark matter . 
 we postulate six families of particles five of which are dark . 
 this leads to the unavoidable postulation of six parallel worlds , the visible one and five invisible worlds . 
 a close study of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , baryon asymmetries , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) bounds , galaxy dynamics , together with the standard model assumptions , help us to set a limit on the mass and width of the new gauge boson .

"the interaction of a weakly bound rydberg electron with an electromagnetic half - cycle pulse ( hcp ) is described with the help of a multidimensional semiclassical treatment . 
 this approach relates the quantum evolution of the electron to its underlying classical dynamics . 
 the method is nonperturbative and is valid for arbitrary spatial and temporal shapes of the applied hcp . on the basis of this approach angle- and 
 energy - resolved spectra resulting from the ionization of rydberg atoms by hcps are analyzed . 
 the different types of spectra obtainable in the sudden - impact approximation are characterized in terms of the appearing semiclassical scattering phenomena . 
 typical modifications of the spectra originating from finite pulse effects are discussed ."
"we investigate and compare different optical probes of a condensed state of microcavity polaritons in expected experimental conditions of non - resonant pumping . 
 we show that the energy- and momentum - resolved resonant rayleigh signal provide a distinctive probe of condensation as compared to , e.g. , photoluminescence emission . 
 in particular , the presence of a collective sound mode both above and below the chemical potential can be observed , as well as features directly related to the density of states of particle - hole like excitations . both resonant rayleigh response and the absorption and photoluminescence , 
 are affected by the presence of quantum well disorder , which introduces a distribution of oscillator strengths between quantum well excitons at a given energy and cavity photons at a given momentum . as we show 
 , this distribution makes it important that in the condensed regime , scattering by disorder is taken into account to all orders . 
 we show that , in the low density linear limit , this approach correctly describes inhomogeneous broadening of polaritons . 
 in addition , in this limit , we extract a linear blue - shift of the lower polariton versus density , with a coefficient determined by temperature and by a characteristic disorder length ."
"we examine the role of resonant coupled channel final state interactions ( fsi ) , as well as weak annihilation and exchange contributions in explaining all the two body hadronic @xmath0 decay modes data . in the un - unitarized amplitudes we include

 the z - series expansion method is used to get the @xmath1 dependence . 
 the fsi effects are incorporated via a phenomenological approach with widths of resonances to various channels taken from observations where available , and others as additional parameters to be determined from fits of all the theoretical rates to the measured ones . 
 our results for the rather hard to explain @xmath2 are in agreement with measured values . 
 we demonstrate that both weak exchange as well as fsi effects are required to get the correct branching ratio for the @xmath3 mode . using our unitarized amplitudes

"quantum oscillations in the binary antiferromagnetic metal feas are presented and compared to theoretical predictions for the electronic band structure in the anomalous spin density wave state of this material . demonstrating a new method for growing single crystals out of bi flux 
 , we utilize the highest quality feas to perform torque magnetometry experiments up to 35 t , using rotations of field angle in two planes to provide evidence for one electron and one hole band in the magnetically ordered state . 
 the resulting picture agrees with previous experimental evidence for multiple carriers at low temperatures , but the exact fermi surface shape disagrees with predictions , suggesting correlations play a role in deviation from ab initio theory and cause up to a four - fold enhancement in the effective electron mass .

"the stationary thermionic electron emission currents from heated metals are compared against an analytical expression derived using a non equilibrium quantum kappa energy distribution for the electrons . 
 this later depends on the temperature decreasing parameter @xmath0 which can be estimated from the raw experimental data and characterizes the departure of the electron energy spectrum from the equilibrium fermi - dirac statistics . 
 the calculations accurately predict the measured thermionic emission currents for both high and moderate temperature ranges . 
 the richardson - dushman law governs the electron emission for large values of kappa or equivalently , for moderate metal temperatures . the high energy tail in the electron energy distribution function which develops at higher temperatures or lower kappa parameters , increases the emission currents well over the predictions of the classical expression . 
 this analysis also permits the quantitative estimation of the departure of the metal electrons from the equilibrium fermi - dirac statistics ."

 we obtain that , compared to the symmetric case , the ordering process slows down dramatically . concerning the asymptotic behavior it is algebraic and characterized by the allen - cahn growth exponent @xmath0 . 
 the late stages of the evolution are preceded by a transient regime strongly affected by both the temperature and the degree of asymmetry of the alloy .

"multidimensional reactive flow models of accreted hydrogen rich envelopes on top of degenerate cold white dwarfs are very effective tools for the study of critical , non spherically symmetric , behaviors during the early stages of nova outbursts . 
 such models can shed light both on the mechanism responsible for the heavy element enrichment observed to characterize nova envelope matter and on the role of perturbations during the early stages of ignition of the runaway . 
 the complexity of convective reactive flow in multi - dimensions makes the computational model itself complex and sensitive to the details of the numerics . in this study 
 , we demonstrate that the imposed outer boundary condition can have a dramatic effect on the solution . 
 several commonly used choices for the outer boundary conditions are examined . 
 it is shown that the solutions obtained from lagrangian simulations , where the envelope is allowed to expand and mass is being conserved , are consistent with spherically symmetric solutions . in eulerian schemes which utilize an outer boundary condition of free outflow , the outburst can be artificially quenched ."

"we use our recently proposed accelerated dynamics algorithm @xcite to calculate temperature and stress dependence of activation free energy for surface nucleation of dislocations in pristine gold nanopillars under realistic loads . 
 while maintaining fully atomistic resolution , we achieve the fraction of a second time - scale regime . 
 we find that the activation free energy depends significantly and non - linearly on the driving force ( stress or strain ) and temperature , leading to very high activation entropies . 
 we also perform compression tests on gold nanopillars for strain rates varying between 7 orders of magnitudes , reaching as low as @xmath0 . 
 our calculations bring out the perils of high strain - rate molecular dynamics calculations : we find that while the failure mechanism for @xmath1 compression of gold nanopillars remains the same across the entire strain - rate range , the elastic limit ( defined as stress for nucleation of the first dislocation ) depends significantly on the strain - rate . 
 we also propose a new methodology that overcomes some of the limits in our original accelerated dynamics scheme ( and accelerated dynamics methods in general ) .

"the existence of a minimal and fundamental length scale , say , the planck length , is a characteristic feature of almost all the models of quantum gravity . 
 the presence of the fundamental length is expected to lead to an improved ultra - violet behavior of the semi - classical propagators . 
 the hypothesis of path integral duality provides a prescription to evaluate the modified propagator of a free , quantum scalar field in a given spacetime , taking into account the existence of the fundamental length in a locally lorentz invariant manner . 
 we use this prescription to compute the quantum gravitational modifications to the propagators in spacetimes with constant curvature , and show that : ( i )  the modified propagators are ultra - violet finite , and ( ii )  the modifications are non - perturbative in the planck length . 
 we discuss the implications of our results ."

 this seeming contradiction can be resolved via analysis that treats measurements as boundary constraints . 
 it is well - known that boundaries can induce apparently - discrete behavior in continuous systems , and strong analogies can be drawn to the case of quantum measurement . 
 if quantum discreteness arises in this manner , this would not only indicate an analog reality , but would also offer a solution to the so - called `` measurement problem '' ."
"we present a classical analysis of the transient response of josephson junctions perturbed by microwaves and thermal fluctuations . 
 the results include a specific low frequency modulation in phase and amplitude behavior of a junction in its zero - voltage state . 
 this transient modulation frequency is linked directly to an observed variation in the probability for the system to switch to its non - zero voltage state . complementing previous work on linking classical analysis to the experimental observations of rabi - oscillations 
 , this expanded perturbation method also provides closed form analytical results for attenuation of the modulations and the rabi - type oscillation frequency . 
 results of perturbation analysis are compared directly ( and quantitatively ) to numerical simulations of the classical model as well as published experimental data , suggesting that transients to phase - locking are closely related to the observed oscillations ."

 the objective is to provide a tool kit that can be used to connect the morphologies of radio agns in galaxy clusters to the dynamical state of the local icm . 
 the formalism is intended to apply to jets whether they are relativistic or non - relativistic . 
 special attention is paid to interactions involving icm shocks , although the results can be applied more broadly .

"twisted light is light carrying orbital angular momentum . 
 the profile of such a beam is a ring - like structure with a node at the beam axis , where a phase singularity exists . due to the strong spatial inhomogeneity the mathematical description of twisted - light 
 matter interaction is non - trivial , in particular close to the phase singularity , where the commonly used dipole - moment approximation can not be applied . in this paper 
 we show that , if the handedness of circular polarization and the orbital angular momentum of the twisted - light beam have the same sign , a hamiltonian similar to the dipole - moment approximation can be derived . 
 however , if the signs differ , in general the magnetic parts of the light beam become of significant importance and an interaction hamiltonian which only accounts for electric fields is inappropriate . 
 we discuss the consequences of these findings for twisted - light excitation of a semiconductor nanostructures , e.g. , a quantum dot , placed at the phase singularity ."

 the first , sample g , contains pulsars which are detectable in blind searches of @xmath0-ray data from the _ fermi _ large area telescope . the second , 
 sample r , contains pulsars detectable in blind radio searches which have spin - down luminosities @xmath1  erg s@xmath2 . 
 we analyse the fraction of the @xmath0-ray - selected sample g which have detectable radio pulses and the fraction of the radio - selected sample r which have detectable @xmath0-ray pulses . 
 twenty of our 35 sample g pulsars have already observed radio pulses . 
 this rules out low - altitude polar - cap beaming models if , as is currently believed , @xmath0-ray beams are generated in the outer magnetosphere and are very wide . 
 we further find that , for the highest-@xmath3 pulsars , the radio and @xmath0-ray beams have comparable beaming factors , i.e. , the beams cover similar regions of the sky as the star rotates . for lower-@xmath3 
 @xmath0-ray emitting pulsars , the radio beams have about half of the @xmath0-ray sky coverage . 
 these results suggest that , for high-@xmath3 young and millisecond pulsars , the radio emission originates in wide beams from regions high in the pulsar magnetosphere , probably close to the null - charge surface and to the @xmath0-ray emitting regions . 
 furthermore , it suggests that for these high-@xmath4 pulsars , as in the @xmath0-ray case , features in the radio profile represent caustics in the emission beam pattern ."
"the conditions of local thermodynamic equilibrium of baryons ( non - strange , strange ) and mesons ( strange ) are presented for central au + au collisions at fair energies using the microscopic transport model urqmd . the net particle density , longitudinal - to - transverse pressure anisotropy and inverse slope parameters of the energy spectra of non - strange and strange hadrons are calculated inside a cell in the central region within rapidity window @xmath0 at different time steps after the collision .

"we have applied a powerful numerical approach to compute , with a high resolution , the structure of dusty circumstellar disks with embedded planets . 
 we emphasize some testable implications of our simulations which would verify the presence of a planet via thermal emission of one or more dusty clumps which are in mean motion resonances with the planet . 
 in particular , our simulations indicate that vega may have a massive planet of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 being jupiter s mass ) at a distance of 5060  au , and epsilon eri may have a less massive planet of @xmath2 at a similar distance of 5565 au . 
 this conclusion is testable : each resonant feature is stationary in the reference frame co - rotating with the planet , but it is not so for the observer at earth . 
 therefore , if our interpretation of asymmetric clumps in circumstellar disks as dynamical resonant structures is correct , the above pattern revolves around the star with an angular velocity of @xmath3/yr ( vega ) and @xmath4/yr ( @xmath5  eri )  a prediction that can be tested on a timescale of several years .

"the paper concerns two interacting consumer - resource pairs based on chemostat - like equations under the assumption that the dynamics of the resource is considerably slower than that of the consumer . 
 the presence of two different time scales enables to carry out a fairly complete analysis of the problem . 
 this is done by treating consumers and resources in the coupled system as fast - scale and slow - scale variables respectively and subsequently considering developments in phase planes of these variables , fast and slow , as if they are independent . 
 when uncoupled , each pair has unique asymptotically stable steady state and no self - sustained oscillatory behavior ( although damped oscillations about the equilibrium are admitted ) . when the consumer - resource pairs are weakly coupled through direct reciprocal inhibition of consumers , the whole system exhibits self - sustained relaxation oscillations with a period that can be significantly longer than intrinsic relaxation time of either pair . 
 it is shown that the model equations adequately describe locally linked consumer - resource systems of quite different nature : living populations under interspecific interference competition and lasers coupled via their cavity losses ."
"in four space - time dimensions , there are good theoretical reasons for believing that general relativity is the correct geometrical theory of gravity , at least at the classical level . if one admits the possibility of extra space - time dimensions , what would we expect classical gravity to be like ? 
 it is often stated that the most natural generalisation is lovelock s theory , which shares many physical properties with gr . 
 but there are also key differences and problems . 
 a potentially serious problem is the breakdown of determinism , which can occur when the matrix of coefficients of second time derivatives of the metric degenerates . 
 this can be avoided by imposing inequalities on the curvature . 
 here it is argued that such inequalities occur naturally if the lovelock action is obtained from weyl s formulae for the volume and surface area of a tube . 
 part of the purpose of this article is to give a treatment of the weyl tube formula in terminology familiar to relativists and to give an appropriate ( straightforward ) generalisation to a tube embedded in minkowski space .

"inspired by a class of algorithms proposed by farhi _

"a continuous stochastic background of gravitational waves ( gws ) for burst sources is produced if the mean time interval between the occurrence of bursts is smaller than the average time duration of a single burst at the emission , i.e. , the so called duty cycle must be greater than one . to evaluate the background of gws produced by an ensemble of sources , during their formation , for example , one needs to know the average energy flux emitted during the formation of a single object and the formation rate of such objects as well . in many cases the energy flux emitted during an event of production of gws 
 is not known in detail , only characteristic values for the dimensionless amplitude and frequencies are known . here 
 we present a shortcut to calculate stochastic backgrounds of gws produced from cosmological sources . for this approach 
 it is not necessary to know in detail the energy flux emitted at each frequency . 
 knowing the characteristic values for the `` lumped '' dimensionless amplitude and frequency we show that it is possible to calculate the stochastic background of gws produced by an ensemble of sources .    2"

"using a set of zoomed - in cosmological simulations of high - redshift progenitors of massive galaxies , we isolate and trace the history of gas that is accreted by central supermassive black holes . 
 we determine the origins of the accreted gas , in terms of whether it entered the galaxy during a merger event or was smoothly accreted . 
 furthermore , we designate whether the smoothly accreted gas is accreted via a cold flow or is shocked upon entry into the halo . for moderate - mass ( @xmath0 m@xmath1 ) black holes at @xmath2 , there is a preference to accrete cold flow gas than gas of shocked or merger origin . 
 however , this result is a consequence of the fact that the entire galaxy has a higher fraction of gas from cold flows . in general 
 , each black hole tends to accrete the same fractions of smooth- and merger - accreted gas as is contained in its host galaxy , suggesting that once gas enters a halo it becomes well - mixed , and its origins are erased . 
 we find that the angular momentum of the gas upon halo entry is a more important factor ; black holes preferentially accrete gas that had low angular momentum when it entered the galaxy , regardless of whether it was accreted smoothly or through mergers ."

"this article focuses on the calculation of spectral functions for single- and multi - impurity models using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) . to calculate spectral functions in dmrg , 
 the correction vector method is presently the most widely used approach . 
 one , however , always obtains lorentzian convoluted spectral functions , which in applications like the dynamical mean - field theory can lead to wrong results . in order to overcome this restriction , 
 we use chain decompositions in which the resulting effective hamiltonian can be diagonalized completely to calculate a discrete `` peak '' spectrum . 
 we show that this peak spectrum is a very good approximation to a deconvolution of the correction vector spectral function . 
 calculating this deconvoluted spectrum directly from the dmrg basis set and operators is the most natural approach , because it uses only information from the system itself . 
 having calculated this excitation spectrum , one can use an arbitrary broadening to obtain a smooth spectral function , or directly analyze the excitations . as a nontrivial test 
 we apply this method to obtain spectral functions for a model of three coupled anderson impurities . 
 although , we are focusing in this article on impurity models , the proposed method for calculating the peak spectrum can be easily adapted to usual lattice models ."
"we present three - dimensional hydrodynamic models of radio galaxies interacting with initially relaxed hot atmospheres and explore the significant off - axis radio lobe structures which result under certain conditions . with a focus on the `` winged '' and `` x - shaped '' radio galaxy population , we confirm the importance of observed trends such as the connection of wing formation with jets co - aligned with the major axis of the surrounding atmosphere . 
 these wings are formed substantially by the deflection of lobe plasma flowing back from the hot spots ( backflow ) and develop in two stages : supersonic expansion of an overpressured cocoon at early times followed by buoyant expansion at later times . 
 we explore a limited parameter space of jet and atmosphere properties and find that the most prominent wings are produced when a decaying jet is injected into a small , dense , highly elliptical atmosphere . on the basis of this search , we argue that the deflection of backflow by gradients in the hot atmosphere is a strong candidate for forming observed wings but must work in tandem with some other mechanism for forming the initial wing channels . 
 our models indicate that lobe interaction with the hot atmosphere may play a dominant role in shaping the morphology of radio galaxies ."
"a graphene antidot lattice , created by a regular perforation of a graphene sheet , can exhibit a considerable band gap required by many electronics devices . 
 however , deviations from perfect periodicity are always present in real experimental setups and can destroy the band gap . 
 our numerical simulations , using an efficient linear - scaling quantum transport simulation method implemented on graphics processing units , show that disorder that destroys the band gap can give rise to a transport gap caused by anderson localization . 
 the size of the defect induced transport gap is found to be proportional to the radius of the antidots and inversely proportional to the square of the lattice periodicity . 
 furthermore , randomness in the positions of the antidots is found to be more detrimental than randomness in the antidot radius .

"we report the discovery of extended radio emission in the phoenix cluster ( spt - cl j23444243 , z=0.596 ) with the gmrt at 610  mhz . 
 the diffuse emission extends over a region of at least 400500  kpc and surrounds the central radio source of the brightest cluster galaxy , but does not appear to be directly associated with it . 
 we classify the diffuse emission as a radio mini - halo , making it the currently most distant mini - halo known . 
 radio mini - halos have been explained by synchrotron emitting particles re - accelerated via turbulence , possibly induced by gas sloshing generated from a minor merger event . 
 chandra observations show a non - concentric x - ray surface brightness distribution , which is consistent with this sloshing interpretation . 
 the mini - halo has a flux density of @xmath0  mjy , resulting in a 1.4  ghz radio power of @xmath1  w  hz@xmath2 . the combined cluster emission , which includes the central compact radio source , is also detected in a shallow gmrt  156  mhz observation and together with the 610  mhz data we compute a spectral index of @xmath3 for the overall cluster radio emission .

"we have made a detailed and quantitative study of dilepton production via bremsstrahlung of a virtual photon during pion - pion collisions . 
 most calculations of electromagnetic radiation from strong interaction processes rely on the soft photon approximation ( spa ) . 
 the conditions underlying this approximation are generally violated when dilepton spectra are calculated in terms of their invariant mass , so that an approach going beyond the spa becomes necessary . 
 superseding previous derivations , we derive an exact formula for the bremsstrahlung cross section . 
 the resulting formulation is compared to various forms based on the spa , the two - particle phase space approximation and rckl s formula using a relativistic one boson exchange ( obe ) model . within the obe approach , 
 we show that approximations to the bremsstrahlung dilepton cross sections often differ greatly from the exact result ; discrepancies become greater both with rising temperature and with invariant mass . 
 integrated dilepton production rates are overestimated by rckl - based approximations by factors 1.58.0 . 
 the largest discrepancies occur for the reaction @xmath0 , where such approximations overestimate the exact rate by factors ranging from 2 to 30 for invariant masses between 10 and 500 mev . 
 our findings , combined with recent estimates of the landau - pomeranchuk effect , indicate that bremsstrahlung dileptons rates in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions should be even more suppressed than had been thought before ."

"cable theory has been developed over the last decades , usually assuming that the extracellular space around membranes is a perfect resistor . 
 however , extracellular media may display more complex electrical properties due to various phenomena , such as polarization , ionic diffusion or capacitive effects , but their impact on cable properties is not known . in this paper , we generalize cable theory for membranes embedded in arbitrarily complex extracellular media . 
 we outline the generalized cable equations , then consider specific cases . 
 the simplest case is a resistive medium , in which case the equations recover the traditional cable equations . 
 we show that for more complex media , for example in the presence of ionic diffusion , the impact on cable properties such as voltage attenuation can be significant . 
 we illustrate this numerically always by comparing the generalized cable to the traditional cable . 
 we conclude that the nature of intracellular and extracellular media may have a strong influence on cable filtering as well as on the passive integrative properties of neurons ."
"we consider a controlled quantum system whose finite dimensional state is governed by a discrete - time nonlinear markov process . in open - loop , 
 the measurements are assumed to be quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) . 
 the eigenstates of the measured observable are thus the open - loop stationary states : they are used to construct a closed - loop supermartingale playing the role of a strict control lyapunov function . 
 the parameters of this supermartingale are calculated by inverting a metzler matrix that characterizes the impact of the control input on the kraus operators defining the markov process . 
 the resulting state feedback scheme , taking into account a known constant delay , provides the almost sure convergence of the controlled system to the target state . 
 this convergence is ensured even in the case where the filter equation results from imperfect measurements corrupted by random errors with conditional probabilities given as a left stochastic matrix .

"we present monte carlo simulations of the reversible transverse susceptibility ( rts ) for a hexagonal array of dipolar interacting magnetic nanoparticles with random anisotropy .

 with increasing temperature the rts curves evolve from a three - peak ( @xmath0 ) structure to a double - peak and eventually a single - peak at the blocking temperature of the system . 
 this trend is preserved for weak interactions . 
 dipolar interactions at low temperature are responsible for the suppression of the @xmath1 peak in the out - of - plane geometry and its progressive merge to the @xmath2 peak with decreasing interparticle separation in the in - plane geometry . 
 the @xmath2 peaks are located at higher field values in the out - of - plane geometry relative to the in - plane one . 
 when the bias field lies in - plane ( out - of - plane ) the @xmath2 peaks are shown to shift to lower ( higher ) field values with decreasing interparticle separation . the @xmath1 peak shifts to lower field values in both geometries .

 in addition , our model provides a clear physical picture that brings insight into understanding biphoton optics with this new source . 
 we apply our model to recent work on generating narrow - band ( and even subnatural linewidth ) paired photons using the technique of electromagnetically induced transparency and slow - light effect in cold atoms , and find good agreements with experimental results ."
"multiple sclerosis is a degenerative condition of the central nervous system that affects nearly 2.5 million of individuals in terms of their physical , cognitive , psychological and social capabilities . 
 researchers are currently investigating on the use of patient reported outcome measures for the assessment of impact and evolution of the disease on the life of the patients . to date , a clear understanding on the use of such measures to predict the evolution of the disease is still lacking . in this work we resort to regularized machine learning methods for binary classification and multiple output regression 
 we propose a pipeline that can be used to predict the disease progression from patient reported measures . 
 the obtained model is tested on a data set collected from an ongoing clinical research project ."
"brownian motion of an array of harmonically coupled particles subject to a periodic substrate potential and driven by an external bias is investigated . in the linear response limit ( small bias ) 
 , the coupling between particles may enhance the diffusion process , depending on the competition between the harmonic chain and the substrate potential . 
 an analytical formula of the diffusion rate for the single - particle case is also obtained . in the nonlinear response regime , 
 the moving kink may become phase - locked to its radiated phonon waves , hence the mobility of the chain may decrease as one increases the external force ."
"we covariantize the decoupling limit of massive gravity proposed in @xcite and study the cosmology of this theory as a proxy , which embodies key features of the fully non - linear covariant theory . 
 we first confirm that it exhibits a self - accelerating solution , similar to what has been found in @xcite , where the hubble parameter corresponds to the graviton mass . for a certain range of parameters fluctuations relative to the self - accelerating background are stable and form an attractor solution . 
 we also show that a degravitating solution can not be constructed in this covariantized proxy theory in a meaningful way . as for cosmic structure formation 
 , we find that the helicity-0 mode of the graviton causes an enhancement relative to @xmath0cdm . for consistency 
 we also compare proxy theories obtained starting from different frames in the decoupling limit and discuss the possibility of obtaining a non - representative proxy theory by choosing the wrong starting frame .

 there were a total of six triplets with nearly equal split , which were identified as @xmath0 = 1 modes caused by rotation . in order to fit the six @xmath0 = 1 modes , grids of white dwarf models 
 are generated by wdec . 
 for the core composition profiles , we choose the linear fittings to carbon profile of white dwarf models from mesa , which can be considered as results of real nuclear burning process . coupled with diffusion equilibrium h / he and he / c mixtures , we make grids of models in wdec and do asteroseismology works on hs0507 + 0434b .

"by employing four typical equation of states ( eoss ) of the inner crust matters , the constraint on properties of low - mass neutron stars are theoretically investigated . 
 based on the well known fact that there is a big gap between the neutron stars and white dwarfs in the mass - radius sequence of compact stars , here we explicitly point out the forbidden region for the central density and stellar radius to form a compact stars , that is , there is no compact star in the nature having central density in the region from about @xmath0 to @xmath1 , and there is also no compact star having a radius in the region from about 400 km to 2000 km . it is found that for a low - mass neutron star with central densities at subnuclear densities , the stellar mass is mainly determined by the softness of the eos at the higher density region ( @xmath2 ) while the stellar radius is dependent on the softness of the eos at lower density region ( @xmath3 ) . for a stable neutron star with stellar mass near the minimum mass , 
 the keplerian period is several hundred millisecond , the moment of inertia is in an order of @xmath4 , and the surface gravitational redshift is in an order of @xmath5 ."

 a generic solution is characterized by spiky features and apparent `` discontinuities '' in the wave amplitudes . 
 it is shown that the nonlinear terms in the wave equations drive the system generically to the `` small velocity '' avtd regime and that the spiky features are caused by the absence of these terms at isolated spatial points .    # 1tt@xmath1#1"
"the milky way can act as a large - scale weak gravitational lens of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . 
 we study this effect using a photon ray - tracing code and a galactic mass distribution with disk , bulge and halo components . for an observer at the sun 
 s coordinates in the galaxy , the bending of cmb photon paths is limited to less than one arcsecond , and only for rays that pass within a few degrees of the galactic center . 
 however , the entire sky is affected , resulting in global distortions of the cmb on large angular scales . 
 these distortions can cause the low - order multipoles of a spherical harmonic expansion of the cmb sky temperature to leak into higher - order modes . 
 thus the component of the cmb dipole that results from the local group s motion relative to the local cosmic frame of rest contributes to higher - order moments for an observer in the solar system . with our ray - tracing code 
 we show that the phenomenon is not sensitive to the specific choice of galactic potential . 
 we also quantitatively rule it out as a contributor to cmb anomalies such as power asymmetry or correlated alignment of low - order multipole moments ."
"we report the discovery of a tight substellar companion to the young solar analog pz tel , a member of the  pic  moving group observed with high contrast adaptive optics imaging as part of the gemini nici planet - finding campaign . 
 the companion was detected at a projected separation of 16.4@xmath01.0 au ( 0.33@xmath00.01  ) in april 2009 . 
 second - epoch observations in may 2010 demonstrate that the companion is physically associated and shows significant orbital motion . 
 monte carlo modeling constrains the orbit of pz tel b to eccentricities @xmath10.6 . 
 the near - ir colors of pz  tel  b indicate a spectral type of m7@xmath02 and thus this object will be a new benchmark companion for studies of ultracool , low - gravity photospheres . adopting an age of 12@xmath2  myr for the system , we estimate a mass of 36@xmath06  based on the lyon / dusty evolutionary models . 
 pz  tel  b is one of few young substellar companions directly imaged at orbital separations similar to those of giant planets in our own solar system . 
 additionally , the primary star pz  tel  a shows a 70 @xmath3 m emission excess , evidence for a significant quantity of circumstellar dust that has not been disrupted by the orbital motion of the companion ."
"the present matter density of the universe , while highly inhomogeneous on small scales , displays approximate homogeneity on large scales . 
 we propose that whereas it is justified to use the friedmann - lema^ itre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) line element ( which describes an exactly homogeneous and isotropic universe ) as a template to construct luminosity distances in order to compare observations with theory , the _ evolution _ of the scale factor in such a construction must be governed not by the standard einstein equations for the flrw metric , but by the modified friedmann equations derived by buchert @xcite in the context of spatial averaging in cosmology . 
 furthermore , we argue that this scale factor , defined in the spatially averaged cosmology , will correspond to the effective flrw metric _ provided _ the size of the averaging domain coincides with the scale at which cosmological homogeneity arises . 
 this allows us , in principle , to compare predictions of a spatially averaged cosmology with observations , in the standard manner , for instance by computing the luminosity distance versus red - shift relation . 
 the predictions of the spatially averaged cosmology would in general differ from standard flrw cosmology , because the scale - factor now obeys the modified flrw equations . 
 this could help determine , by comparing with observations , whether or not cosmological inhomogeneities are an alternative explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration ."
"understanding models which represent the invasion of network - based systems by infectious agents can give important insights into many real - world situations , including the prevention and control of infectious diseases and computer viruses . 
 here we consider markovian susceptible - infectious - susceptible ( sis ) dynamics on finite strongly connected networks , applicable to several sexually transmitted diseases and computer viruses . in this context , a theoretical definition of endemic prevalence is easily obtained via the quasi - stationary distribution ( qsd ) . by representing the model as a percolation process and utilising the property of duality 
 , we also provide a theoretical definition of invasion probability . 
 we then show that , for undirected networks , the probability of invasion from any given individual is equal to the ( probabilistic ) endemic prevalence , following successful invasion , at the individual ( we also provide a relationship for the directed case ) . 
 the total ( fractional ) endemic prevalence in the population is thus equal to the average invasion probability ( across all individuals ) . 
 consequently , for such systems , the regions or individuals already supporting a high level of infection are likely to be the source of a successful invasion by another infectious agent . 
 this could be used to inform targeted interventions when there is a threat from an emerging infectious disease ."
"we report on the diffusive - ballistic thermal conductance of multi - moded single - crystal silicon beams measured below 1 k. it is shown that the phonon mean - free - path @xmath0 is a strong function of the surface roughness characteristics of the beams . 
 this effect is enhanced in diffuse beams with lengths much larger than @xmath0 , even when the surface is fairly smooth , 5 - 10 nm rms , and the peak thermal wavelength is 0.6 @xmath1 m . 
 resonant phonon scattering has been observed in beams with a pitted surface morphology and characteristic pit depth of 30 nm . 
 hence , if the surface roughness is not adequately controlled , the thermal conductance can vary significantly for diffuse beams fabricated across a wafer . 
 in contrast , when the beam length is of order @xmath0 , the conductance is dominated by ballistic transport and is effectively set by the beam area . we have demonstrated a uniformity of @xmath28% in fractional deviation for ballistic beams , and this deviation is largely set by the thermal conductance of diffuse beams that support the micro - electro - mechanical device and electrical leads . 
 in addition , we have found no evidence for excess specific heat in single - crystal silicon membranes . 
 this allows for the precise control of the device heat capacity with normal metal films . 
 we discuss the results in the context of the design and fabrication of large - format arrays of far - infrared and millimeter wavelength cryogenic detectors ."

 in addition , we resolve the rotationally broadened absorption features of the secondary star for the first time , deriving a rotation speed of @xmath3kms@xmath4 ( 1@xmath2 ) which leads to a mass ratio of @xmath5 @xmath0 0.04 ( 1@xmath2 , assuming a tidally - locked and roche lobe - filling secondary ) . 
 hence with the lack of x - ray eclipses ( i.e. @xmath6 ) we can set firm 95%  confidence lower limits to the neutron star mass of @xmath7m@xmath1 and to the companion star mass of @xmath8m@xmath1 . however , by additionally requiring that the companion must exceed 0.75m@xmath1 ( as required theoretically to produce a steady low - mass x - ray binary ) , then @xmath9m@xmath1 and @xmath10 ( 95%  confidence lower and upper limit , respectively ) , thereby making cygx-2 the highest mass neutron star measured to date .

"according to dyson s three fold way , from the viewpoint of global time reversal symmetry there are three circular ensembles of unitary random matrices relevant to the study of chaotic spectra in quantum mechanics . 
 these are the circular orthogonal , unitary and symplectic ensembles , denoted coe , cue and cse respectively . for each of these three ensembles and their thinned versions , 
 whereby each eigenvalue is deleted independently with probability @xmath0 , we take up the problem of calculating the first two terms in the scaled large @xmath1 expansion of the spacing distributions . it is well known that the leading term admits a characterisation in terms of both fredholm determinants and painlev transcendents . 
 we show that modifications of these characterisations also remain valid for the next to leading term , and that they provide schemes for high precision numerical computations . in the case of the cue 
 there is an application to the analysis of odlyzko s data set for the riemann zeros , and in that case some further statistics are similarly analysed ."
"we examine the scaling properties of an evolving network of strings in minkowski spacetime and study the evolution of length scales in terms of a 3-scale model proposed by austin , copeland and kibble ( ack ) . 
 we find good qualitative and some quantitative agreement between the model and our simulations . 
 we also investigate small - scale structure by altering the minimum allowed size for loop production @xmath0 . 
 certain quantities depend significantly on this parameter : for example the scaling density can vary by a factor of two or more with increasing @xmath0 . 
 small - scale structure as defined by ack disappears if no restrictions are placed on loop production , and the fractal dimension of the string changes smoothly from 2 to 1 as the resolution scale is decreased . 
 loops are nearly all produced at the lattice cut - off . 
 we suggest that the lattice cut - off should be interpreted as corresponding to the string width , and that in a real network loops are actually produced with this size . 
 this leads to a radically different string scenario , with particle production rather than gravitational radiation being the dominant mode of energy dissipation . at the very least , a better understanding of the discretisation effects in all simulations of cosmic strings 
 is called for ."
"we propose wave and ray approaches for modelling mid- and high- frequency structural vibrations through smoothed joints on thin shell cylindrical ridges . the models both emerge from a simplified classical shell theory setting .

 the corresponding full wave scattering model is studied using the finite difference method to investigate the scattering properties of an incident plane wave . through both models

 the antiferromagnetic long - range spin ordering in bafe@xmath0se@xmath0o below @xmath2=240 k leaves a fingerprint both in the a@xmath1 and b@xmath1 phonon mode linewidth and energy . in the energy range between 400 and 650 @xmath3

 the onset value of magnetic continuum ( 2@xmath4 ) is found at about 437 @xmath3 at 15 k. the magnetic continuum disappears at about 623 k , which lead us to conclude that the short - range magnetic ordering in bafe@xmath0se@xmath0o exists apparently up to 2.6@xmath2 ."
"amorphous solids , and many disordered lattices , exhibit a remarkable qualitative and quantitative universality in their acoustic properties at temperature @xmath0k . 
 this phenomenon is attributed to the existence of tunneling two - level systems ( ttlss ) , characterized by a homogenous density of states ( dos ) at energies much lower than the disorder energy ( @xmath1ev ) . here 
 we calculate numerically , from first principles , the dos of kbr : cn glass , the archetypal disordered lattice showing universality . 
 in contrast to the standard tunneling model , we find that the dos diminishes abruptly at @xmath2k , and that tunneling states differ essentially by their symmetry under inversion . 
 this structure of the ttlss dictates the low temperature below which universality is observed , and the quantitative universality of the acoustic properties in glasses . 
 consequences to the properties of glasses at intermediate temperatures , as well as to the microscopic structure of amorphous solids , are discussed ."

 the physical length scales relevant in the explosion process cover 11 orders of magnitude and turbulent effects dominate the physical mechanism . despite these challenges , three - dimensional simulations of type ia supernova explosions 
 have recently become possible and pave the way to a better understanding of these important astrophysical objects ."
"it is well known that any link can be represented by the closure of a braid . 
 the minimum number of strings needed in a braid whose closure represents a given link is called the braid index of the link and the well known morton - frank - williams inequality reveals a close relationship between the homfly polynomial of a link and its braid index . in the case that a link is already presented in a closed braid form , jaeger derived a special formulation of the homfly polynomial . in this paper , we prove a variant of jaeger s result as well as a dual version of it . unlike jaeger s original reasoning , which relies on representation theory , our proof uses only elementary geometric and combinatorial observations . 
 using our variant and its dual version , we provide a direct and elementary proof of the fact that the braid index of a link that has an @xmath0-string closed braid diagram that is also reduced and alternating , is exactly @xmath0 . until know this fact was only known as a consequence of a result due to murasugi on fibered links that are star products of elementary torus links and of the fact that alternating braids are fibered ."

 we find that in the leading kinematic region where the transverse momentum imbalance of the two jets , @xmath0 , is much less than the momentum of either jet , the contribution from the lowest non - trivial perturbative order to both the spin - averaged and the spin - dependent dijet cross sections can be factorized into a hard part that is a function only of the averaged jet momentum @xmath1 , and perturbatively generated transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) parton distributions .

"we determine the character of orbits of stars moving in the meridional plane @xmath0 of an axially symmetric time - independent disk galaxy model with a spherical central nucleus . 
 in particular , we try to reveal the influence of the value of the angular momentum on the different families of orbits of stars , by monitoring how the percentage of chaotic orbits , as well as the percentages of orbits of the main regular resonant families evolve when angular momentum varies . 
 the smaller alignment index ( sali ) was computed by numerically integrating the equations of motion as well as the variational equations to extensive samples of orbits in order to distinguish safely between ordered and chaotic motion . 
 in addition , a method based on the concept of spectral dynamics that utilizes the fourier transform of the time series of each coordinate is used to identify the various families of regular orbits and also to recognize the secondary resonances that bifurcate from them . 
 our investigation takes place both in the physical @xmath0 and the phase @xmath1 space for a better understanding of the orbital properties of the system . 
 our numerical computations reveal that low angular momentum stars are most likely to move in chaotic orbits , while on the other hand , the vast majority of high angular momentum stars perform regular orbits .

"the broad - band variability of many accreting systems displays characteristic structure ; log - normal flux distributions , rms - flux relations , and long inter - band lags . 
 these characteristics are usually interpreted as inward propagating fluctuations in an accretion disk driven by stochasticity of the angular momentum transport mechanism . 
 we present the first analysis of propagating fluctuations in a long - duration , high - resolution , global three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulation of a geometrically - thin ( @xmath0 ) accretion disk around a black hole . while the dynamical - timescale turbulent fluctuations in the maxwell stresses are too rapid to drive radially - coherent fluctuations in the accretion rate 
 , we find that the low - frequency quasi - periodic dynamo action introduces low - frequency fluctuations in the maxwell stresses which then drive the propagating fluctuations . 
 examining both the mass accretion rate and emission proxies , we recover log - normality , linear rms - flux relations , and radial coherence that would produce inter - band lags . 
 hence , we successful relate and connect the phenomenology of propagating fluctuations to modern mhd accretion disk theory ."

"we present radiative one - loop neutrino mass model with hypercharge zero scalar triplet in conjunction with another charged singlet scalar and an additional vectorlike lepton doublet . 
 we study three variants of this mass model : the first one without additional beyond - sm symmetry , the second with imposed dm - stabilizing discrete @xmath0 symmetry , and the third in which this @xmath0 symmetry is promoted to the gauge symmetry @xmath1 . 
 the two latter cases are scotogenic , with a neutral component of the scalar triplet as a dark matter candidate . in first scotogenic model 
 the @xmath0-odd dark matter candidate is at the multi - tev mass scale , so that all new degrees of freedom are beyond the direct reach of the lhc . in second scotogenic setup , with

"necessary and sufficient conditions for deterministic remote extraction and destruction of qubit information encoded in bipartite states using only local operations and classical communications ( locc ) are presented . 
 the conditions indicate that there is a way to asymmetrically spread qubit information between two parties such that it can be remotely extracted with unit probability at one of the parties but not at the other as long as they are using locc . 
 remote destruction can also be asymmetric between the two parties , but the conditions are incompatible with those for remote extraction ."
"we consider the problem of a single level quantum dot coupled to the edge of a one - dimensional luttinger liquid wire by both a hopping term and electron - electron interactions . 
 using bosonization and coulomb gas mapping of the anderson - yuval type we show that thermodynamic properties of the level , in particular , its occupation , depend on the various interactions in the system only through a single quantity  the corresponding fermi edge singularity exponent . 
 however , dynamical properties , such as the level density of states , depend in a different way on each type of interaction . 
 hence , we can construct different models , with and without interactions in the wire , with equal fermi edge singularity exponents , which have identical population curves , although they originate from very different level densities of states . 
 the latter may either be regular or show a power - law suppression or enhancement at the fermi energy . 
 these predictions are verified to a high degree of accuracy using the density matrix renormalization group algorithm to calculate the dot occupation , and classical monte carlo simulations on the corresponding coulomb gas model to extract the level density of states .    ,

 new notions of eigenvalues / eigenvectors for complex tensors are introduced , extending similar properties from the hermitian matrices .

"we consider utility maximization in networks where the sources do not employ flow control and may consequently overload the network . in the absence of flow control at the sources , some packets will inevitably have to be dropped when the network is in overload . to that end , we first develop a distributed , threshold - based packet dropping policy that maximizes the weighted sum throughput . 
 next , we consider utility maximization and develop a receiver - based flow control scheme that , when combined with threshold - based packet dropping , achieves the optimal utility . 
 the flow control scheme creates virtual queues at the receivers as a _ push - back _ mechanism to optimize the amount of data delivered to the destinations via back - pressure routing . 
 a novel feature of our scheme is that a utility function can be assigned to a collection of flows , generalizing the traditional approach of optimizing per - flow utilities . 
 our control policies use finite - buffer queues and are independent of arrival statistics . 
 their near - optimal performance is proved and further supported by simulation results ."
"as one of the recently proposed algorithms for sparse system identification , @xmath0 norm constraint least mean square ( @xmath0-lms ) algorithm modifies the cost function of the traditional method with a penalty of tap - weight sparsity . 
 the performance of @xmath0-lms is quite attractive compared with its various precursors .

 this paper presents comprehensive theoretical performance analysis of @xmath0-lms for white gaussian input data based on some assumptions which are reasonable in a large range of parameter setting . 
 expressions for steady - state mean square deviation ( msd ) are derived and discussed with respect to algorithm parameters and system sparsity .

"we searched for eclipses of two millisecond pulsars , psr j1807@xmath02459 and psr b1908 + 00 . 
 these pulsars are in very low mass binary systems with orbital parameters similar to those of eclipsing binaries . 
 observations were made with the gbt at frequencies as low as 575mhz . 
 no eclipses were detected in either system . 
 observations of well - established eclipsing binary j2051@xmath00827 found eclipses to be substantially weaker than previously seen , with the pulsar detected throughout the eclipse region at 575mhz and with an electron column density an order of magnitude smaller than previously measured .

"we present radio transient search algorithms , results , and statistics from the ongoing arecibo pulsar alfa ( palfa ) survey of the galactic plane . 
 we have discovered seven objects through a search for isolated dispersed pulses . 
 all of these objects are galactic and have measured periods between 0.4 and 4.7  s. one of the new discoveries has a duty cycle of 0.01% , smaller than that of any other radio pulsar . 
 we discuss the impact of selection effects on the detectability and classification of intermittent sources , and compare the efficiencies of periodicity and single - pulse searches for various pulsar classes . for some cases 
 we find that the apparent intermittency is likely to be caused by off - axis detection or a short time window that selects only a few bright pulses and favors detection with our single - pulse algorithm . 
 in other cases , the intermittency appears to be intrinsic to the source . 
 no transients were found with dispersion measures large enough to require that they originate from sources outside our galaxy . 
 accounting for the on - axis gain of the alfa system , as well as the low gain but large solid - angle coverage of far - out sidelobes , we use the results of the survey so far to place limits on the amplitudes and event rates of transients of arbitary origin ."

 ( 1 ) for @xmath2 the zb oscillations are permanent , for @xmath3 they are transient . ( 2 ) for @xmath2 many zb frequencies appear , for @xmath3 only one frequency is at work . ( 3 ) for @xmath2 both interband and intraband ( cyclotron ) frequencies contribute to zb , for @xmath3 there are no intraband frequencies .

 the new inequalities use redefined correlation functions , which involve averaged products of local rates rather than intensities .

"grover s search algorithm is the optimal quantum algorithm that can search an unstructured database quadratically faster than any known classical algorithm . 
 the role of entanglement and correlations in the search algorithm have been studied in great detail and it is known that entanglement between the qubits is necessary to gain a quadratic speedup , for pure state implementation of the grover search algorithm . here , we systematically investigate the behavior of quantum coherence and monogamy of entanglement in the discrete analogue of the _ analog analogue of grover search algorithm_. the analog analogue of grover search is a continuous time quantum algorithm based on the adiabatic hamiltonian evolution that gives a quadratic speedup , similar to the original grover search algorithm . 
 we show that the decrease of quantum coherence , quantified using various coherence monotones , is a clear signature of attaining the maximum success probability in the analog grover search . 
 we also show that for any two qubit reduced density matrix of the system , the concurrence evolves in close vicinity to the increasing rate of success probability .

"we present _ chandra _ observations of two nearby radio galaxies in group environments , 3c285 and 3c442a . 
 the host galaxies of both sources are involved in mergers with nearby massive galaxies , and the hot gas in the systems is extended along lines joining the interacting galaxies . 
 both sources show strong evidence for interactions between the radio lobes and the asymmetrical hot gas . 
 we argue that the structure in the hot gas is independent of the existence of the radio lobes in these systems , and argue that hot gas shaped by an ongoing massive galaxy merger may play an important role in the dynamics of radio lobes in other objects . for 3c442a , 
 our observations show that gas is being driven out of both members of the host interacting galaxy pair , and the implied constraints on galaxy velocities are consistent with mildly supersonic motions with respect to the group - scale hot gas . 
 the previously known filamentary radio structure in the center of 3c442a may be a result of the interaction between hot gas expelled from these galaxies and pre - existing radio - emitting plasma . in 3c285 , where there is no ongoing galaxy merger 
 , the powerful radio source is probably having a significant effect on the energetics of the host group ."

 the polarization pattern is highly ordered and is aligned with the long axis of the filament throughout most of the region , diverging only near the southern boundary by @xmath0@xmath1 . if the polarization arises from thermal emission of dust grains aligned via either paramagnetic inclusions or radiative torques , this configuration indicates a plane - of - sky magnetic field which is normal to the filament along most of its length .

 we investigate several interacting spin ( e.g. ising and heisenberg ) and fermion ( e.g. anderson and aubry - andr ) models to obtain the intrinsic decoherence time as a function of disorder and interaction strength ."
"we present a spectroscopic study of the four extended star clusters ( escs ) in ngc 6822 based on the data obtained with gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) on the gemini - south 8.1 m telescope . 
 their radial velocities derived from the spectra range from @xmath0 km s@xmath1 ( for c1 ) to @xmath2 km s@xmath1 ( for c4 ) and , unlike the intermediate age carbon stars , they do not display any sign of systematic rotation around ngc 6822 . 
 the ages and metallicities derived using the lick indices show that the escs are old ( @xmath3 gyr ) and metal poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath4 ) . 
 ngc 6822 is found to have both metal poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath5 ) and metal rich ( [ fe / h]@xmath6 ) star clusters within 15 arcmin ( 2 kpc ) from the center , while only metal poor clusters are observed in the outer halo with @xmath7 arcmin ( 2.6 kpc ) . 
 the kinematics , old ages , and low metallicities of escs suggest that escs may have accreted into the halo of ngc 6822 . 
 based on the velocity distribution of escs , we have determined the total mass and the mass - to - light ratio of ngc 6822 : @xmath8 and @xmath9 . 
 it shows that ngc 6822 is one of the most dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies in the local group ."

"star clusters are formed in molecular clouds which are believed to be the birth places of most stars . from recent observational data 
 , @xcite estimated that only 4% to 7% of the clusters embedded inside molecular clouds have survived . 
 an important mechanism for the disruption of embedded ( bound)-clusters is the dispersion of the parent cloud by uv radiation , stellar winds and/or supernova explosions . in this work we study the effect of this mechanism by n - body simulations . 
 we find that most embedded - clusters survive for more than 30 myr even when different initial conditions of the cluster may introduce some minor variations , but the general result is rather robust .

"the observation and imaging of hundreds or thousands of radio sources with the technique of very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) is a computationally intensive task .

"we compare the results of numerical simulations of thin and quasi - spherical ( thick ) accretion flows with existing analytical solutions . 
 we use a lagrangian code based on the smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) scheme and an eulerian finite difference code based on the total variation diminishing ( tvd ) scheme . in one - dimensional thin flows , 
 the results of the simulations , with or without shocks , agree very well with each other and with analytical solutions . in two - dimensional thick flows , 
 the general features , namely the locations and strengths of centrifugal and turbulent pressure supported shocks , centrifugal barriers , and the funnel walls which are expected from analytical models , agree very well , though the details vary . 
 generally speaking , the locations of the shocks may be better obtained by sph since the angular momentum is strictly preserved in sph , but the shocks themselves are better resolved by tvd . 
 the agreement of these code test results with analytical solutions provides us with confidence to apply these codes to more complex problems which we will discuss elsewhere .

"we present an extremely simplified model of multiple - domains polymer stretching in an atomic force microscopy experiment . 
 we portray each module as a binary set of contacts and decompose the system energy into a harmonic term ( the cantilever ) and long - range interactions terms inside each domain . 
 exact equilibrium computations and monte carlo simulations qualitatively reproduce the experimental saw - tooth pattern of force - extension profiles , corresponding ( in our model ) to first - order phase transitions . 
 we study the influence of the coupling induced by the cantilever and the pulling speed on the relative heights of the force peaks . 
 the results suggest that the increasing height of the critical force for subsequent unfolding events is an out - of - equilibrium effect due to a finite pulling speed . 
 the dependence of the average unfolding force on the pulling speed is shown to reproduce the experimental logarithmic law ."
"the spectra of disc accreting neutron stars generally show complex curvature , and individual components from the disc , boundary layer and neutron star surface can not be uniquely identified . here 
 we show that much of the confusion over the spectral form derives from inadequate approximations for comptonization and for the iron line . 
 there is an intrinsic low energy cutoff in comptonised spectra at the seed photon energy . 
 it is very important to model this correctly in neutron star systems as these have expected seed photon temperatures ( from either the neutron star surface , inner disc or self  absorbed cyclotron ) of @xmath0 kev , clearly within the observed x  ray energy band . 
 there is also reflected continuum emission which must accompany the observed iron line , which distorts the higher energy spectrum . 
 we illustrate these points by a reanalysis of the _ ginga _ spectra of cyg x2 at all points along its z track , and show that the spectrum can be well fit by models in which the low energy spectrum is dominated by the disc , while the higher energy spectrum is dominated by comptonised emission from the boundary layer , together with its reflected spectrum from a relativistically smeared , ionised disc .

"0957 + 561 is the first gravitational lens system to be discovered and first for which a time delay was measured . 
 because the system is unusually rich in observables such as image positions , fluxes , vlbi structure , and polarization it has been modelled quite extensively . 
 however , since it resides in a cluster providing substantial convergence , the velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy is an important component to models . 
 we have measured this dispersion to be @xmath0  ( 1-sigma ) , which implies a hubble constant of @xmath1  ( 1-sigma ) according to the preferred fgs model of grogin and narayan , and @xmath2  ( 1-sigma ) using the spls model .

"we present measurements of the fundamental plane ( fp ) parameters ( the effective radius , the mean effective surface brightness , and the central velocity dispersion ) of six field elliptical galaxies at intermediate redshift .

"we investigate two - dimensional ( 2d ) states of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) with self - attraction or self - repulsion , trapped in an axially symmetric optical - lattice potential periodic along the radius . 
 unlike previously studied 2d models with bessel lattices , no localized states exist in the linear limit of the present model , hence all localized states are truly nonlinear ones . 
 we consider the states trapped in the central potential well , and in remote circular troughs . in both cases , a new species , in the form of _ radial gap solitons _ , are found in the repulsive model ( the gap soliton trapped in a circular trough may additionally support stable dark - soliton pairs ) . in remote troughs 
 , stable localized states may assume a ring - like shape , or shrink into strongly localized solitons . 
 the existence of stable annular states , both azimuthally uniform and weakly modulated ones , is corroborated by simulations of the corresponding gross - pitaevskii equation . 
 dynamics of strongly localized solitons circulating in the troughs is also studied . while the solitons with sufficiently small velocities are stable , fast solitons gradually decay , due to the leakage of matter into the adjacent trough under the action of the centrifugal force .

"plasma proteins such as fibrinogen induce the aggregation of red blood cells ( rbc ) into rouleaux , which are responsible for the pronounced shear thinning behavior of blood , control the erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr )  a common hematological test  and are involved in many situations of physiological relevance such as structuration of blood in the microcirculation or clot formation in pathological situations . 
 confocal microscopy is used to characterize the shape of rbcs within rouleaux at equilibrium as a function of macromolecular concentration , revealing the diversity of contact zone morphology . 
 three different configurations that have only been partly predicted before are identified , namely parachute , male - female and sigmoid shapes , and quantitatively recovered by numerical simulations . 
 a detailed experimental and theoretical analysis of clusters of two cells shows that the deformation increases nonlinearly with the interaction energy . 
 models indicate a forward bifurcation in which the contacting membrane undergoes a buckling instability from a flat to a deformed contact zone at a critical value of the interaction energy .

"timing of high - count rate sources with the _ nustar_small explorer mission requires specialized analysis techniques . _ nustar_was primarily designed for spectroscopic observations of sources with relatively low count - rates rather than for timing analysis of bright objects . 
 the instrumental dead time per event is relatively long ( @xmath02.5  msec ) , and varies by a few percent event - to - event . 
 the most obvious effect is a distortion of the white noise level in the power density spectrum ( pds ) that can not be modeled easily with the standard techniques due to the variable nature of the dead time . in this paper , we show that it is possible to exploit the presence of two completely independent focal planes and use the cross power density spectrum to obtain a good proxy of the white noise - subtracted pds . 
 thereafter , one can use a monte carlo approach to estimate the remaining effects of dead time , namely a frequency - dependent modulation of the variance and a frequency - independent drop of the sensitivity to variability . in this way , 
 most of the standard timing analysis can be performed , albeit with a sacrifice in signal to noise relative to what would be achieved using more standard techniques .

 the impact of the coupling on the dark matter and dark energy components may be asymmetric . while the dark energy decouples from the dark matter at late time , just as other components of the cosmic fluid become decoupled as the universe expands , interestingly , the dark matter may actually become coupled to the dark energy at late time . 
 we shall call such a phenomenon as _ 
 incoupling_. we use the latest type ia supernovae data from the scp team , baryon acoustics oscillation data from sdss and 2df surveys , and the position of the first peak of the cmb angular power spectrum to constrain the model .

"quasar absorption lines provide detailed information on the chemical , kinematic , and ionization conditions in galaxies and their environments , and provide a means for studying the evolution of these conditions back to the epoch of the first quasars . among the collection of absorbing structures along the lines of sight to quasars there is an evolutionary sequence of galaxies that represent predecessors of the milky way and provide a direct view of its history . 
 absorption spectra of lines of sight through the milky way and through nearby galaxies reveal a variety of chemical species , ionization conditions , and kinematic substructures .

"a phenomenological formalism is presented in which the apparent acceleration of the universe is generated by cosmic structure formation , without resort to dark energy , modifications to gravity , or a local void . 
 the observed acceleration results from the combined effect of innumerable local perturbations due to individually virializing systems , overlapping together in a smoothly - inhomogeneous adjustment of the frw metric , in a process governed by the causal flow of inhomogeneity information outward from each clumped system . after noting how common arguments claiming to limit backreaction are physically unrealistic , models are presented which fit the supernova luminosity distance data essentially as well as @xmath0cdm , while bringing several important cosmological parameters to a new concordance . 
 these goals are all achieved with a second - generation version of our formalism that accounts for the negative feedback of causal backreaction upon itself due to the slowed propagation of gravitational inhomogeneity information ."

"we present predictions of the correlation between the ly@xmath0 forest absorption in quasar spectra and the mass within @xmath1 ( comoving ) of the line of sight , using fully hydrodynamic and hydro - pm numerical simulations of the cold dark matter model supported by present observations . 
 the observed correlation based on galaxies and the ly@xmath0 forest can be directly compared to our theoretical results , assuming that galaxies are linearly biased on large scales . 
 specifically , we predict the average value of the mass fluctuation , @xmath2 , conditioned to a fixed value of the ly@xmath0 forest transmitted flux @xmath3 , after they have been smoothed over a @xmath4 cube and line of sight interval , respectively . 
 we find that @xmath5 as a function of @xmath6 has a slope of @xmath7 at this smoothing scale , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the rms dispersions ( this slope should decrease with the smoothing scale ) . 
 we show that this value is largely insensitive to the cosmological model and other ly@xmath0 forest parameters .

"dark matter may be composed of superwimps , superweakly - interacting massive particles produced in the late decays of other particles . 
 we focus on the case of gravitinos produced in the late decays of sleptons or sneutrinos and assume they are produced in sufficient numbers to constitute all of non - baryonic dark matter . 
 at leading order , these late decays are two - body and the accompanying energy is electromagnetic . for natural weak - scale parameters , these decays have been shown to satisfy bounds from big bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background .

"the charge - current - induced spin polarization is a key property of topological insulators for their applications in spintronics . 
 however , topological surface states are expected to give rise to only one type of spin polarization for a given current direction , which has been a limiting factor for spin manipulations . here 
 we report that in devices based on the bulk - insulating topological insulator bisbtese@xmath0 , an unexpected switching of spin polarization was observed upon changing the chemical potential . 
 the spin polarization expected from the topological surface states was detected in a heavily electron - doped device , whereas the opposite polarization was reproducibly observed in devices with low carrier densities . 
 we propose that the latter type of spin polarization stems from topologically - trivial two - dimensional states with a large rashba spin splitting , which are caused by a strong band bending at the surface of bisbtese@xmath0 beneath the ferromagnetic electrode used as a spin detector .

"we present a new statistic  the redshift dispersion which may prove useful for comparing next generation redshift surveys ( e.g. , the sloan digital sky survey ) and cosmological simulations . 
 our statistic is specifically designed for the projection of phase space which is directly measured by redshift surveys . 
 we find that the redshift dispersion of galaxies as a function of the projected overdensity has a strong dependence on the cosmological density parameter @xmath0 . 
 the redshift dispersion statistic is easy to compute and can be motivated by applying the cosmic virial theorem to subsets of galaxies with the same local density . 
 we show that the velocity dispersion of particles in these subsets is proportional to the product of @xmath0 and the local density . 
 low resolution n - body simulations of several cosmological models ( open / closed cdm , cdm+@xmath1 , hdm ) indicate that the proportionality between velocity dispersion , local density and @xmath0 holds over redshift scales in the range 50 @xmath2 to 500 @xmath2 .

"a numerical investigation of two locally applied drag reducing control schemes is carried out in the configuration of a spatially developing turbulent boundary layer ( tbl ) . 
 one control is designed to damp near - wall turbulence and the other induces constant mass flux in the wall - normal direction . both control schemes yield similar local drag reduction rates within the control region . however , the flow development downstream of the control significantly differs : persistent drag reduction is found for the uniform blowing case whereas drag increase is found for the turbulence damping case . in order to account for this difference the formulation of a global drag reduction rate is suggested . 
 it represents the reduction of the streamwise force exerted by the fluid on a finite length plate . 
 furthermore , it is shown that the far downstream development of the tbl after the control region can be described by a single quantity , namely a streamwise shift of the uncontrolled boundary layer , i.e. a changed virtual origin . 
 based on this result , a simple model is developed that allows relating for the local drag reduction rate to the global one without the need of conducting expensive simulations or measurements far downstream of the control region .

 the present grape-9 system has an indirect memory addressing unit and a particle memory large enough to store all particles data and also tree nodes data . 
 the indirect memory addressing unit stores interaction lists for the tree algorithm , which is constructed on host computer , and , according to the interaction lists , force pipelines calculate only the interactions necessary . in our implementation , the interaction calculations are significantly reduced compared to direct @xmath1 summation in the original hermite scheme . for example , we can archive about a factor 30 of speedup ( equivalent to about 17 teraflops ) against the hermite scheme for a simulation of @xmath2 system , using hardware of a peak speed of 0.6 teraflops for the hermite scheme ."

 we derive mostly analytical , closed - form results for several regimes : ( a ) net neutrality , ( b ) social optimum , ( c ) maximum revenue by the isp , or ( d ) maximum isp revenue under quality differentiation . 
 one unexpected conclusion is that ( a ) and ( b ) will differ significantly , unless average cp productivity is very high ."

"interactions are known to have dramatic effects on bosonic gases in one dimension ( 1d ) . 
 not only does the ground state transform from a condensate - like state to an effective fermi sea , but new fundamental excitations , which do not have any higher - dimensional equivalents , are predicted to appear . in this work , 
 we trace these elusive excitations via their effects on the dynamical structure factor of 1d strongly - interacting bose gases at low temperature . 
 an array of 1d bose gases is obtained by loading a @xmath0rb condensate in a 2d lattice potential . 
 the dynamical structure factor of the system is probed by energy deposition through low - momentum bragg excitations . 
 the experimental signals are compared to recent theoretical predictions for the dynamical structure factor of the lieb - liniger model at @xmath1 .

"the mitotic spindle is an important intermediate structure in eucaryotic cell division , in which each of a pair of duplicated chromosomes is attached through microtubules to centrosomal bodies located close to the two poles of the dividing cell . 
 it is widely believed that the spindle starts forming by the ` capture ' of chromosome pairs , held together by kinetochores , by randomly searching microtubules . 
 we present a complete analytical formulation of this problem , in the case of a single fixed target and for arbitrary cell size . 
 we derive a set of green s functions for the microtubule dynamics and an associated set of first passage quantities . an implicit analytical expression for the probability distribution of the search time

"the high - mass star - forming site g009.62 + 00.20e hosts the 6.7ghz methanol maser source with the greatest flux density in the galaxy which has been flaring periodically over the last ten years .

 the radio continuum emission was resolved in two sources separated by 1300  au . 
 the ch@xmath0oh maser cloudlets are distributed along two north - south ridges of emission to the east and west of the strongest radio continuum component . 
 this component likely pinpoints a massive young stellar object which heats up its dusty envelope , providing a constant ir pumping for the class   ch@xmath0oh maser transitions . 
 we suggest that the periodic maser activity may be accounted for by an independent , pulsating , ir radiation field provided by a bloated protostar in the vicinity of the brightest masers .

 clear - signature evidences of giant conductance phenomena for hole transmission without valence - band mixing through a dbrt and a superlattice were found . 
 the giant conductance effect losses robustness by manipulating the number of superlattice layers and by including the valence - band particles coupling as well . 
 phase time through the heterostructure exhibits extremal dependencies in the gaps and in the barriers , as those reported before for electrons . 
 we have detected an earlier arrival phase time for the propagation of both flavors of holes within the barrier , in the order of few tenths of picoseconds . 
 an appealing filter - like effect is presented , whenever a selective confinement strength arises independently for both flavors of holes in the uncoupled regime .

"realistic 3-dimensional ( 3d ) , radiative hydrodynamical surface convection simulations of the metal - poor halo stars hd140283 and hd84937 have been performed . due to the dominance of adiabatic cooling over radiative heating 
 very low atmospheric temperatures are encountered . 
 the lack of spectral lines in these metal - poor stars thus causes much steeper temperature gradients than in classical 1d hydrostatic model atmospheres where the temperature of the optically thin layers is determined by radiative equilibrium . the modified atmospheric structures cause changes in the emergent stellar spectra . 
 in particular , the primordial li abundances may have been overestimated by 0.2 - 0.35dex with 1d model atmospheres .

"holonomic gates for quantum computation are commonly considered to be robust against certain kinds of parametric noise , the very motivation of this robustness being the geometric character of the transformation achieved in the adiabatic limit . on the other hand ,

 the obtained results suggest that the finite time gates present some effects of cancellation of the perturbations introduced by the noise which mimic the geometrical cancellation effect of standard holonomic gates .

"inverse bicontinuous cubic phases are ubiquitous in lipid - water mixtures and consist of a lipid bilayer forming a cubic minimal surface , thereby dividing space into two cubic networks of water channels . for small hydrocarbon chain lengths , 
 the monolayers can be modeled as parallel surfaces to a minimal midsurface . 
 the bending energy of the cubic phases is determined by the distribution of gaussian curvature over the minimal midsurfaces which we calculate for seven different structures ( g , d , p , i - wp , c(p ) , s and f - rd ) . 
 we show that the free - energy densities of the structures g , d and p are considerably lower than those of the other investigated structures due to their narrow distribution of gaussian curvature . 
 the bonnet transformation between g , d , and p implies that these phases coexist along a triple line , which also includes an excess water phase .

 spin - orbit coupling strongly influences the magnetic excitations , which is most visible in large energies of the magnetic zone - center modes arising from magnetic anisotropy . 
 we find evidence for a low - lying additional mode that exhibits strongest scattering intensity near the antiferromagnetic zone center . 
 this extra signal can be explained by a sizable magnetic moment of 0.11 bohr magnetons on the apical oxygens parallel to the ru moment , which is found in the density functional theory calculations .

"we show that , nonlinear optical processes of nanoparticles can be controlled by the presence of interactions with a molecule or a quantum dot . by choosing the appropriate level spacing for the quantum emitter

"field theories invariant to conformal transformations are a very important class of models . besides their theoretical significance due to their large symmetry group , they are important also from the practical point of view . for instance 
 the kinematic part of the standard model lagrangian also shows conformal invariance . in the usual approach 
 , a field theory is called conformal invariant whenever its field equations or its action is invariant to the conformal transformations of the spacetime metric tensor along with corresponding transformation of the field quantities . for this , an action of the conformal transformations on the fields needs to be specified a priori , and conformal invariance only makes sense along with this group action . 
 it this paper we introduce a simple new method of generating field theories in terms of their lagrangian , without a priori specifying the action of the conformal group on the fields . 
 the interesting aspect of this method is that it does not to refer to a spacetime metric tensor a priori , and therefore becomes particularly useful when searching for theories where the spacetime metric tensor is an emergent quantity , not a fundamental field .

 we find that an exponential ltd is not favored by the observed statistical properties of @xmath0 for young pulsars and fails to explain the fact that @xmath0 is negative for roughly half of the old pulsars . 
 a simple power - law ltd can explain all the observed statistical properties of @xmath0 . 
 finally we discuss some physical implications of our results to models of the @xmath1-decay of nss and suggest reliable determination of the true ages of many young nss is needed , in order to constrain further the physical mechanisms of their @xmath1-decay . 
 our model can be further tested with the measured evolutions of @xmath2 and @xmath0 for an individual pulsar ; the decay index , oscillation amplitude and period can also be determined this way for the pulsar ."

"we study a minimal shell model for the advection of a passive scalar by a gaussian time correlated velocity field . the anomalous scaling properties of the white noise limit are studied analytically . 
 the effect of the time correlations are investigated using perturbation theory around the white noise limit and non - perturbatively by numerical integration . 
 the time correlation of the velocity field is seen to enhance the intermittency of the passive scalar ."
"we investigate collective modes in three dimensional ( 3d ) gapless multi - weyl semimetals with anisotropic energy band dispersions ( i.e. , @xmath0 with a positive integer @xmath1 ) . for comparison 
 , we also consider the gapless semimetals with the isotropic band dispersions ( i.e. @xmath2 ) . 
 we calculate analytically long - wavelength plasma frequencies incorporating interband transitions and chiral properties of carriers . for both the isotropic and anisotropic cases , 
 we find that interband transitions and chirality lead to the depolarization shift of plasma frequencies . for the isotropic parabolic band dispersion the long - wavelength plasmons do not decay via landau damping , while for the higher - order band dispersions the long - wavelength plasmons experience damping below a critical density . for systems with the anisotropic dispersion the density dependence of the long - wavelength plasma frequency along the direction of non - linear dispersion behaves like that of the isotropic linear band model , while along the direction of linear dispersion it behaves like that of the isotropic non - linear model . 
 plasmons along both directions remain undamped over a broad range of densities due to the chirality induced depolarization shift . 
 our results provide a comprehensive picture of how band dispersion and chirality affect plasmon behaviors in 3d gapless chiral systems with the arbitrary band dispersion ."
"very recently quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems made of attractive fermionic alkali - metal atoms with a widely tunable interaction due to fano - feshbach resonances have been realized . in this way 
 it has been achieved the 2d crossover from the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer regime of weakly - interacting cooper pairs to the bose - einstein condensate regime strongly bound dimers . 
 these experiments pave the way to the investigation of 2d strongly - interacting attractive fermions during the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition from a low - temperature superfluid phase characterized by quasi - condensation to a high - temperature normal phase , where vortex proliferation driven by quantum and thermal fluctuations completely destroys superfluidity . in this paper 
 we discuss our preliminar theoretical results on the behavior of the bkt critical temperature across the crossover . 
 our microscopic calculations are based on functional integration taking into account renormalized gaussian fluctuations and the crucial 2d effect of vortex - antivortex unbinding .

"the dominant component of the ( 100 mev - 50 gev ) grb emission detected by lat starts with a delay relative to the prompt soft ( sub - mev ) gamma - rays and lasts long after the soft component fades . 
 this has lead to the intriguing suggestion that this high energy emission is generated via synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons accelerated by the external shock . 
 moreover , the limits on the mev afterglow emission lead to the suggestion that , at least in bright gev bursts the field is not amplified beyond compression in the shock . we show here that considerations of confinement ( within the decelerating shock ) , efficiency and cooling of the emitting electrons constrain , within this model , the magnetic fields that arise in both the upstream ( circum burst ) and downstream ( ejecta ) regions , allowing us to obtain a direct handle on their values . the well known limit on the maximal synchrotron emission , when combined with the blast wave evolution , implies that late photons ( arriving more than @xmath0 100 s after the burst ) with energies higher than @xmath110gev do not arise naturally from external shock synchrotron and almost certainly have a different origin . 
 finally , even a modest seed flux ( a few mjy ) at ir - optical would quench , via inverse compton cooling , the gev emission unless the magnetic field is significantly amplified behind the shock . 
 an observation of a burst with simultaneous ir - optical and gev emission will rule out this model ."
"we explore observational constraints on a cosmological brane - world scenario in which the bulk is not empty . 
 rather , exchange of mass - energy between the bulk and the bane is allowed . 
 the evolution of matter fields to an observer on the brane is then modified due to new terms in the energy momentum tensor describing this exchange . 
 we investigate the constraints from various cosmological observations on the flow of matter from the bulk into the brane . 
 interestingly , we show that it is possible to have a @xmath0 cosmology to an observer in the brane which satisfies standard cosmological constraints including the cmb temperature fluctuations , type ia supernovae at high redshift , and the matter power spectrum . 
 this model even accounts for the observed suppression of the cmb power spectrum at low multipoles . in this cosmology 
 , the observed cosmic acceleration is attributable to the flow of matter from the bulk to the brane . 
 a peculiar aspect of this cosmology is that the present dark - matter content of the universe may be significantly larger than that of a @xmath1cdm cosmology . 
 its influence , however , is offset by the dark - radiation term . 
 possible additional observational tests of this new cosmological paradigm are suggested ."
"we present theoretical and experimental evidence of a universal mechanism through which temporal cavity solitons of externally - driven , passive , kerr resonators can form robust long - range bound states . these bound states , sometime also referred to as multi - soliton states or soliton crystals in microresonators , require perturbations to the strict lugiato - lefever mean field description of temporal cavity solitons . binding occurs when the perturbation excites a narrowband resonance in the soliton spectrum , which gives long oscillatory tails to the solitons . 
 those tails can then interlock for a discrete set of temporal separations between the solitons . 
 the universality of this mechanism is demonstrated in fiber ring cavities by providing experimental observations of long - range bound states ensuing from three different perturbations : third - order dispersion ( dispersive wave generation ) , the periodic nature of the cavity ( kelly sidebands ) , and the random birefringence of the resonator . 
 sub - picosecond resolution of bound state separations and their dynamics are obtained by using the dispersive fourier transform technique . 
 good agreement with theoretical models , including a new vector mean - field model , is also reported ."

 the spectrum and radiative widths are evaluated using two models , the relativized godfrey - isgur model and a nonrelativistic potential model . 
 the electromagnetic transitions are evaluated using coulomb plus linear plus smeared hyperfine wavefunctions , both in a nonrelativistic potential model and in the godfrey - isgur model . 
 the open - flavor strong decay amplitudes are determined assuming harmonic oscillator wavefunctions and the @xmath1p@xmath2 decay model .

"we discuss two phenomenological descriptions of low - current transport in bilayer quantum hall system with exciton condensates , one based on a landauer - buttiker description of andreev scattering at contacts to coherent bilayers and one based on a simplified single - parameter _ p - ology _ description of the weak to strong interlayer coupling crossover . 
 the andreev scattering phenomenology in intended to apply when the condensate is well developed and is used to predict current - voltage relationships for a variety of two contact geometries . 
 we also apply this formalism to circumstances in which the tunnel current exceeds its critical value and the condensate is time - dependent . 
 the _

"we carry out quantum inelastic scattering calculations of collisions of rb atoms with inverting nh@xmath0 and nd@xmath0 molecules in the energy range between 0 and 100 @xmath1 , which are important for experiments using velocity - controlled molecular beams to probe scattering resonances . 
 we focus on molecules initially in the upper level of the ammonia inversion doublet for @xmath2 , which is low - field - seeking and can be controlled in a stark decelerator . 
 we calculate the integral elastic and state - to - state inelastic cross sections in the coupled states approximation . 
 we demonstrate the presence of both shape and feshbach resonances in the elastic and inelastic cross sections at low collision energies and discuss their origin in terms of the bound states of rb

 we also consider elastic and inelastic cross sections in the ultracold regime , using close - coupling calculations , in order to assess the viability of sympathetic cooling of nd@xmath0 by rb . the inelastic cross section for relaxation to the lower level of the inversion doublet is smaller than expected for such a strongly coupled system , but is still likely to be too large to allow sympathetic cooling for nd@xmath0 in low - field - seeking states . 
 however , there is a good prospect that sympathetic cooling will be possible for molecules in high - field - seeking states , even when the collision partner is a magnetically trapped atom in a low - field - seeking state ."
"deep multi - color galaxy surveys with photometric redshifts will provide a large number of two - point correlation observables : galaxy - galaxy angular correlations , galaxy - shear cross correlations , and shear - shear correlations between all redshifts . 
 these observables can potentially enable a joint determination of the dark energy dependent evolution of the dark matter and distances as well as the relationship between galaxies and dark matter halos . with recent cmb determinations of the initial power spectrum , a measurement of the mass clustering at even a _ 
 single _ redshift will constrain a well - specified combination of dark energy parameters in a flat universe ; we provide convenient fitting formulae for such studies . 
 the combination of galaxy - shear and galaxy - galaxy correlations can determine this amplitude at _ multiple _ redshifts . 
 we illustrate this ability in a description of the galaxy clustering with 5 free functions of redshift which can be fitted from the data . 
 the galaxy modeling is based on a mapping onto halos of the same abundance that models a flux - limited selection . in this context and under a flat geometry 
 , a 4000 deg@xmath0 galaxy - lensing survey can achieve a _ statistical _ precision of @xmath1 for the dark energy density , @xmath2 and @xmath3 for its equation of state and evolution , evaluated at dark energy matter equality @xmath4 , as well as constraints on the 5 halo functions out to @xmath5 . 
 more importantly , a joint analysis can make dark energy constraints robust against systematic errors in the shear - shear correlation and halo modeling ."
"we discuss recent developments in the study of primordial black holes , focussing particularly on their formation and quantum evaporation . 
 such studies can place important constraints on models of the early universe . 
 an especially interesting development has been the realization that such constraints may be severely modified if the value of the gravitational  constant "" @xmath0 varies with cosmological epoch , a possibility which arises in many scenarios for the early universe . 
 the nature of the modification depends upon whether the value of @xmath0 near a black hole maintains the value it had at its formation epoch ( corresponding to gravitational memory ) or whether it tracks the background cosmological value . 
 this is still uncertain but we discuss various approaches which might help to resolve the issue ."
"by introducing a temporal change timescale @xmath0 for the time - dependent system hamiltonian , a general formulation of the markovian quantum master equation is given to go well beyond the adiabatic regime . 
 in appropriate situations , the framework is well justified even if @xmath0 is faster than the decay timescale of the bath correlation function . 
 an application to the dissipative landau - zener model demonstrates this general result . 
 the findings are applicable to a wide range of fields , providing a basis for quantum control beyond the adiabatic regime ."
"previous studies suggest that the planet  forming disks around very  low  mass stars / brown dwarfs may be flatter than those around more massive stars , in contrast to model predictions of larger scale heights for gas  disks around lower  mass stars . 
 we conducted a statistically robust study to determine whether there is evidence for stellar  mass  dependent disk structure in planet  forming disks . 
 we find a statistically significant difference in the spitzer / irac color distributions of disks around very  low 
 mass and low  mass stars all belonging to the same star - forming region , the chamaeleon i star  forming region . 
 we show that self consistently calculated disk models can not fit the median spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the two groups . 
 these seds can be only explained by flatter disk models , consistent with the effect of dust settling in disks . 
 we find that relative to the disk structure predicted for flared disks the required reduction in disk scale height is anti  correlated with the stellar mass , i.e. disks around lower  mass stars are flatter . 
 our results show that the initial and boundary conditions of planet formation are stellar  mass  dependent , an important finding that must be considered in planet formation models ."
"we consider the phase coherent transport of a quasi one - dimensional beam of bose - einstein condensed particles through a disordered potential of length @xmath0 . among the possible different types of flow we identified [ t. paul , p. schlagheck , p. leboeuf and n. pavloff , phys .

"we report an analysis of the interstellar @xmath0-ray emission in the third galactic quadrant measured by the fermi large area telescope . 
 the window encompassing the galactic plane from longitude @xmath1 to @xmath2 has kinematically well - defined segments of the local and the perseus arms , suitable to study the cosmic - ray densities across the outer galaxy . 
 we measure no large gradient with galactocentric distance of the @xmath0-ray emissivities per interstellar h atom over the regions sampled in this study . 
 the gradient depends , however , on the optical depth correction applied to derive the h  column densities . 
 no significant variations are found in the interstellar spectra in the outer galaxy , indicating similar shapes of the cosmic - ray spectrum up to the perseus arm for particles with gev to tens of gev energies . 
 the emissivity as a function of galactocentric radius does not show a large enhancement in the spiral arms with respect to the interarm region . 
 the measured emissivity gradient is flatter than expectations based on a cosmic - ray propagation model using the radial distribution of supernova remnants and uniform diffusion properties . in this context , observations require a larger halo size and/or a flatter cr source distribution than usually assumed . the molecular mass calibrating ratio , @xmath3 , is found to be @xmath4 in the local - arm clouds and is not significantly sensitive to the choice of h  spin temperature .

"it has recently been suggested that compton downscattering may give rise to the broad iron lines seen in the x - ray spectra of seyfert 1 galaxies . 
 this challenges the standard model in which these lines originate from the innermost regions of the black hole accretion disk with doppler shifts and gravitational redshifts giving rise to the broadened line profile . here 
 , we apply observational constraints to the compton downscattering model for mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 and ngc  3516 , the two best cases to date of seyfert galaxies with relativistically broad lines . 
 we show that the continuum source in mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 required by the constrained model violates the black body limit . in the case of ngc  3516 , only a very small region of parameter space 
 is compatible with the constraints . 
 hence , we conclude that the comptonization model is not a viable one for the broad line seen in these two objects . 
 the accretion disk model remains the best interpretation of these data .

"this letter presents a revised radiative transfer model for the infrared ( ir ) emission of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . 
 while current models assume that the ir is emitted from a dusty torus in the equatorial plane of the agn , spatially resolved observations indicate that the majority of the ir emission from @xmath0100pc in many agn originates from the polar region , contradicting classical torus models . 
 the new model _ cat3d - wind _ builds upon the suggestion that the dusty gas around the agn consists of an inflowing disk and an outflowing wind . here 
 , it is demonstrated that ( 1 ) such disk+wind models cover overall a similar parameter range of observed spectral features in the ir as classical clumpy torus models , e.g. the silicate feature strengths and mid - ir spectral slopes , ( 2 ) they reproduce the @xmath1 bump observed in many type 1 agn unlike torus models , and ( 3 ) they are able to explain polar emission features seen in ir interferometry , even for type 1 agn at relatively low inclination , as demonstrated for ngc3783 . 
 these characteristics make it possible to reconcile radiative transfer models with observations and provide further evidence of a two - component parsec - scaled dusty medium around agn : the disk gives rise to the @xmath1 near - ir component , while the wind produces the mid - ir emission . 
 the model seds will be made available for download ."
"dual agns are natural byproducts of hierarchical mergers of galaxies in the @xmath0cdm cosmogony . 
 recent observations have shown that only a small fraction ( @xmath1 ) of agns at redshift @xmath2 are dual with kpc - scale separations , which is rather low compared to the high merger rate of galaxies . here 
 we construct a phenomenological model to estimate the number density of dual agns and its evolution according to the observationally - estimated major merger rates of galaxies and various scaling relations on the properties of galaxies and their central massive black holes . 
 we show that our model reproduces the observed frequency and separation distribution of dual agns provided that significant nuclear activities are triggered only in gas - rich progenitor galaxies with central massive black holes and only when the nuclei of these galaxies are roughly within the half - light radii of their companion galaxies . under these constraints , 
 the observed low dual agn frequency is consistent with the relatively high merger rate of galaxies and supports the hypothesis that major mergers lead to agn / qso activities . 
 we also predict that the number of kpc - scale dual agns decreases with increasing redshift and only about 0.02%0.06% of agns are dual agns with double - peaked narrow line features at redshifts of @xmath3 . 
 future observations of high - redshift dual agns would provide a solid test for this prediction ."

"the thorup - zwick ( tz ) routing scheme is the first generic stretch-3 routing scheme delivering a nearly optimal local memory upper bound . using both direct analysis and simulation 
 , we calculate the stretch distribution of this routing scheme on random graphs with power - law node degree distributions , @xmath0 . 
 we find that the average stretch is very low and virtually independent of @xmath1 . 
 in particular , for the internet interdomain graph , @xmath2 , the average stretch is around @xmath3 , with up to 70% of paths being shortest 
 . as the network grows , the average stretch slowly decreases . 
 the routing table is very small , too . 
 it is well below its upper bounds , and its size is around @xmath4 records for @xmath5-node networks . 
 furthermore , we find that both the average shortest path length ( i.e.  distance ) @xmath6 and width of the distance distribution @xmath7 observed in the real internet inter - as graph have values that are very close to the minimums of the average stretch in the @xmath6- and @xmath7-directions . 
 this leads us to the discovery of a unique critical quasi - stationary point of the average tz stretch as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath7 . 
 the internet distance distribution is located in a close neighborhood of this point . 
 this observation suggests the analytical structure of the average stretch function may be an indirect indicator of some hidden optimization criteria influencing the internet s interdomain topology evolution ."

"loyal buyer - seller relationships can arise by design , e.g. when a seller tailors a product to a specific market niche to accomplish the best possible returns , and buyers respond to the dedicated efforts the seller makes to meet their needs . 
 we ask whether it is possible , instead , for loyalty to arise spontaneously , and in particular as a consequence of repeated interaction and co - adaptation among the agents in a market . 
 we devise a stylized model of double auction markets and adaptive traders that incorporates these features . 
 traders choose where to trade ( which market ) and how to trade ( to buy or to sell ) based on their previous experience . 
 we find that when the typical scale of market returns ( or , at fixed scale of returns , the intensity of choice ) become higher than some threshold , the preferred state of the system is segregated : both buyers and sellers are segmented into subgroups that are persistently loyal to one market over another . 
 we characterize the segregated state analytically in the limit of large markets : it is stabilized by some agents acting cooperatively to enable trade , and provides higher rewards than its unsegregated counterpart both for individual traders and the population as a whole ."

"in this paper we investigate a multi - source ldpc scheme for a gaussian relay system , where @xmath0 sources communicate with the destination under the help of a single relay ( @xmath1 system ) . since various distributed ldpc schemes in the cooperative single - source system , e.g. bilayer ldpc  @xcite and bilayer multi - edge type ldpc ( bmet - ldpc )  @xcite , 
 have been designed to approach the shannon limit , these schemes can be applied to the @xmath1 system by the relay serving each source in a round - robin fashion .

"we analyze the scattering and bound state physics of a pair of atoms in a one - dimensional optical lattice interacting via a narrow feshbach resonance . 
 the lattice provides a structured continuum allowing for the existence of bound dimer states both below and above the continuum bands , with pairs above the continuum stabilized by either repulsive interactions or their center of mass motion . inside the band the feshbach coupling to a closed channel 
 bound state leads to a fano resonance profile for the transmission , which may be mapped out by rf- or photodissociative spectroscopy . 
 we generalize the scattering length concept to the one - dimensional lattice , where a scattering length may be defined at both the lower and the upper continuum thresholds . as a function of the applied magnetic field the scattering length at 
 either band edge exhibits the usual feshbach divergence when a bound state enters or exits the continuum . near the scattering length divergences the binding energy and wavefunction of the weakly bound dimer state acquires a universal form reminiscent of those of free - space feshbach molecules .

"this is a follow - up to our earlier work on the energies and radial distributions of heavy - light mesons . 
 the heavy quark is taken to be static ( infinitely heavy ) and the light quark has a mass about that of the strange quark . 
 we now concentrate on the energies of the excited states with higher angular momentum and with a radial node . 
 a new improvement is the use of hypercubic blocking in the time direction . 
 the calculation is carried out with dynamical fermions on a @xmath0 lattice with a lattice spacing @xmath1  fm generated using a non - perturbatively improved clover action . in nature 
 the closest equivalent of this heavy - light system is the @xmath2 meson , which allows us to compare our lattice calculations to experimental results ( where available ) or to give a prediction where the excited states , particularly p - wave states , should lie . 
 we pay special attention to the spin - orbit splitting , to see which one of the states ( for a given angular momentum l ) has the lower energy . 
 an attempt is made to understand these results in terms of the dirac equation ."

"the continued observations of sw j1644 + 57 in x - ray and radio bands accumulated a rich data set to study the relativistic jet launched in this tidal disruption event . 
 the x - ray light curve of sw j1644 + 57 from 5 - 30 days presents two kinds of quasi - periodic variations : a 200 second quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) and a 2.7-day quasi - periodic variation . 
 the latter has been interpreted by a precessing jet launched near the bardeen - petterson radius of a warped disk . here 
 we suggest that the @xmath0 200s qpo could be associated with a second , narrower jet sweeping the observer line - of - sight periodically , which is launched from a spinning black hole in the misaligned direction with respect to the black hole s angular momentum . 
 in addition , we show that this two - component jet model can interpret the radio light curve of the event , especially the re - brightening feature starting @xmath1 days after the trigger . from the data we infer that inner jet may have a lorentz factor of @xmath2 and a kinetic energy of @xmath3 , while the outer jet may have a lorentz factor of @xmath4 and a kinetic energy of @xmath5 ."
"we present a study of diffusion enhancement of underdamped brownian particles in 1d symmetric space - periodic potential due to external symmetric time - periodic forcing with zero mean . 
 we show that the diffusivity can be enhanced by many orders of magnitude at appropriate choice of the forcing amplitude and frequency . 
 the diffusivity demonstrates tad , abnormal ( decreasing ) temperature dependence at forcing amplitudes exceeding certain value . at any fixed forcing frequency @xmath0 normal temperature dependence of the diffusivity 
 is restored at low enough temperatures , @xmath1  in contrast with the problem with constant external forcing . at fixed temperature at small forcing frequency 
 the diffusivity either slowly decreases with @xmath0 , or ( at stronger forcing ) goes through a maximum near @xmath2 , reciprocal superdiffusion stage duration . at high frequencies , between @xmath2 and a fraction of the oscillation frequency at the potential minimum 
 , the diffusivity is shown to decrease with @xmath0 according to a power law , with exponent related to the transient superdiffusion exponent . 
 this behavior is found similar for the cases of sinusoidal in time and piecewise constant periodic ( `` square '' ) forcing ."
"the hybrid halide perovskite ch@xmath0nh@xmath0pbi@xmath0 has enabled solar cells to reach an efficiency of about 18% , demonstrating a pace for improvements with no precedents in the solar energy arena . despite such explosive progress , the microscopic origin behind the success of such material is still debated , with the role played by the organic cations in the light - harvesting process remaining unclear . here 
 van - der - waals - corrected density functional theory calculations reveal that the orientation of the organic molecules plays a fundamental role in determining the material electronic properties . 
 for instance , if ch@xmath0nh@xmath0 orients along a ( 011)-like direction , the pbi@xmath1 octahedral cage will distort and the band gap will become indirect .

"the universe with adiabatic matter creation is considered . 
 it is thought that the negative pressure caused by matter creation can play the role of a dark energy component , and drive the accelerating expansion of the universe . 
 using the type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) data , the observational hubble parameter data , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data and the baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) data , we make constraints on the cosmological parameters , assuming a spatially flat universe . 
 our results show that the model with matter creation is consistent with the sne ia data , while the joint constraints of all these observational data disfavor this model . 
 if the cosmological constant is taken into account , a traditional model without matter creation is favored by the joint observations .

"we present the _ suzaku _  broad band observations of two agns detected by the _ swift_/bat hard x - ray ( @xmath015 kev ) survey that did not have previous x - ray data , swift j0601.98636  and swift j0138.64001 . 
 the _ suzaku _ 
 spectra reveals in both objects a heavily absorbed power law component with a column density of @xmath1  @xmath2 that dominates above 10 kev , and an intense reflection component with a solid angle @xmath3 from a cold , optically thick medium . 
 we find that these agns have an extremely small fraction of scattered light from the nucleus , @xmath4 with respect to the intrinsic power law component . 
 this indicates that they are buried in a very geometrically - thick torus with a small opening angle and/or have unusually small amount of gas responsible for scattering . in the former case 
 , the geometry of swift j0601.98636  should be nearly face - on as inferred from the small absorption for the reflection component . 
 the discovery of two such objects in this small sample implies that there must be a significant number of yet unrecognized , very compton thick agns viewed at larger inclination angles in the local universe , which are difficult to detect even in the currently most sensitive optical or hard x - ray surveys ."

 the effect of single atom detuning , cavity decay rate and initial preparation of the atoms on the corresponding correlation measures have been investigated . 
 it is found that even under strong dissipation , time evolution can create high quantum discord while entanglement and bell nonlocality stay zero for an initially separable state . 
 quantum discord increases while entanglement decreases in a certain time period under dissipation for the initial state that both atoms are in the excited state if the qubits are identical . for some type of initial states , 
 cavity decay is shown to drive the system to a stationary state with high entanglement and quantum discord ."

 attractive and repulsive cases are examined for the potential of @xmath0 hyperons . 
 since hyperons soften the eos , they shorten the time interval from the bounce to black hole formation , which corresponds to the duration of neutrino emission . this effect is larger for the attractive case than the repulsive case because @xmath0 hyperons appear more easily . in addition

"we searched for periodic and quasiperiodic signal in the prompt emission of a sample of 44 bright short gamma

 neutron star mergers , but not from double neutron star systems .

 we tailored our search to the nature of the expected signal by properly stretching the observed light curves by an increasing factor with time , after calibrating the technique on synthetic curves . in none of the grbs of our sample we found evidence for periodic or quasiperiodic signals .

"in helical hydromagnetic turbulence with an imposed magnetic field ( which is constant in space and time ) the magnetic helicity of the field within a periodic domain is no longer an invariant of the ideal equations . alternatively , there is a generalized magnetic helicity that is an invariant of the ideal equations . 
 it is shown that this quantity is not gauge invariant and that it can therefore not be used in practice . instead , the evolution equation of the magnetic helicity of the field describing the deviation from the imposed field is shown to be a useful tool . 
 it is demonstrated that this tool can determine steady state quenching of the alpha - effect . 
 a simple three - scale model is derived to describe the evolution of the magnetic helicity and to predict its sign as a function of the imposed field strength . 
 the results of the model agree favorably with simulations ."

"many natural and engineered complex networks have intricate mesoscopic organization , e.g. , the clustering of the constituent nodes into several communities or modules . 
 often , such modularity is manifested at several different hierarchical levels , where the clusters defined at one level appear as elementary entities at the next higher level . using a simple model of a hierarchical modular network , 
 we show that such a topological structure gives rise to characteristic time - scale separation between dynamics occurring at different levels of the hierarchy . 
 this generalizes our earlier result for simple modular networks , where fast intra - modular and slow inter - modular processes were clearly distinguished . investigating the process of synchronization of oscillators in a hierarchical modular network , we show the existence of as many distinct time - scales as there are hierarchical levels in the system . 
 this suggests a possible functional role of such mesoscopic organization principle in natural systems , viz .

 this model reproduces many characteristic features of this observed class of galaxies , such as their clumpy morphologies , smooth and monotonic velocity gradients , high gas fractions ( @xmath5 ) and high specific star - formation rates ( @xmath6 ) . in accord with recent models , giant clumps ( @xmath7 ) form in - situ via gravitational instabilities . 
 however , the galactic winds are critical for their subsequent evolution . 
 the giant clumps we obtain are short - lived and are disrupted by wind - driven mass loss . 
 they do not virialise or migrate to the galaxy centers as suggested in recent work neglecting strong winds . by phenomenologically implementing the winds that are observed from high - redshift galaxies and in particular from individual clumps , our simulations reproduce well new observational constraints on clump kinematics and clump ages . 
 in particular , the observation that older clumps appear closer to their galaxy centers is reproduced in our simulations , as a result of inside - out formation of the disks rather than inward clump migration ."

 the experiments show that for the backward volume magnetostatic spin waves ( which are reciprocal and excited symmetrically in amplitude ) there is a phase difference of @xmath0 associated with the excitation process and thus the phase symmetry is distorted . on the contrary , for the magnetostatic surface spin waves ( which are non - reciprocal and unsymmetrical in amplitude ) the phase symmetry is preserved ( there is no phase difference between the two waves associated with the excitation ) .

"coherent diffraction imaging ( cdi ) of single molecules at atomic resolution is a major goal for the x - ray free electron lasers ( xfels ) . 
 however , during an imaging pulse , the fast laser - induced ionization may strongly affect the recorded diffraction pattern of the irradiated sample . 
 the radiation tolerance of the imaged molecule should then be investigated a priori with a dedicated simulation tool . 
 the continuum approach is a powerful tool for modeling the evolution of irradiated large systems consisting of more than a few hundred thousand atoms . 
 however , this method follows the evolution of average single - particle densities , and the experimentally recorded intensities reflect the spatial two - particle correlations . 
 the information on these correlations is then inherently not accessible within the continuum approach . in this paper 
 we analyze this limitation of continuum models and discuss the applicability of continuum models for imaging studies . 
 we propose a formula to calculate scattered intensities ( including both elastic and inelastic scattering ) from the estimates obtained with a single - particle continuum model . 
 we derive this formula for systems under conditions typical for cdi studies with xfels ."
"we present keck / lris spectra of a candidate damped ly@xmath0 ( dla ) galaxy toward the qso 3c196 ( z@xmath1 = 0.871 ) . 
 the dla absorption system has a redshift of z@xmath2 = 0.437 , and a galaxy at 1.5@xmath3 from the qso has been identified in high resolution imaging with wfpc2/hst . 
 we have detected emission lines of [ o  ii ] @xmath43727 , h@xmath5 , [ o iii ] @xmath45007 , h@xmath0 and [ n ii ] @xmath46584 at the absorption redshift 
 . based on the emission lines , we have found the redshift of the galaxy to be z@xmath1 = 0.4376 @xmath6 0.0006 . 
 the emission lines also enabled us to calculate the extinction - corrected luminosities and metallicity indicators using established indices based on line strengths of different emission lines . 
 these indicators suggest that the ism of the dla galaxy has a high metallicity comparable to or perhaps twice as much as solar ( e.g. 12 + @xmath7(o / h ) = 8.98 @xmath6 0.07 ) .

 the disc becomes progressively fainter as the cooling front moves inwards from the outer regions , until only a small bright region around the white dwarf is left at minimum light . 
 the variable part of the uneclipsed light is possibly due to emission in a wind emanating from the inner parts of the disc .

"we study dynamical effects in proton breakup from a weakly bound state in an exotic nucleus on a heavy target . 
 the coulomb interactions between the proton and the core and the proton and the target are treated to all orders , including also the full multipole expansion of the coulomb potential . 
 the dynamics of proton nuclear and coulomb breakup is compared to that of an _ equivalent _ neutron of larger binding energy in order to elucidate the differences with the well understood neutron breakup mechanism . 
 a number of experimentally measurable observables such as parallel momentum distributions , proton angular distributions and total breakup cross sections are calculated . with respect to nuclear breakup 
 it is found that a proton behaves exactly as a neutron of larger binding energy . 
 the extra `` effective energy '' is due to the combined core - target coulomb barrier . in coulomb breakup 
 we distinguish the effect of the core - target coulomb potential ( called recoil effect ) , with respect to which the proton behaves again as a more bound neutron , from the direct proton - target coulomb potential . 
 the latter gives cross sections about an order of magnitude larger than the recoil term . 
 the two effects give rise to complicated interferences in the parallel momentum distributions . 
 they are instead easily separable in the proton angular distributions which are therefore suggested as a very useful observable for future experimental studies .    *

 turbulence is excited just behind the shock front via kelvin

 the turbulence gradually decays as it goes away from the shock fronts . adopting a phenomenological model for the stochastic acceleration

 our results show that the spatial distribution of high - energy particles is different from those for a steady solution . 
 we also show that the contribution of electrons that escaped from the acceleration regions significantly softens the photon spectrum . 
 the photon spectrum and surface brightness profile are reproduced by our models .

"ch cygni began producing rapid , stochastic optical variations with the onset of symbiotic activity in 1963 . 
 we use changes in this flickering between 1997 and 2000 to diagnose the state of the accretion disk during this time . in the 1998 high state , 
 the luminosity of the @xmath0-band flickering component was typically more than 20 times higher than in the 1997 and 2000 low states . 
 therefore , the physical process or region that produces the flickering was also primarily responsible for the large optical flux increase in the 1998 high state . assuming that the rapid , stochastic optical variations in ch cygni come from the accretion disk , as in cataclysmic variable stars , a change in the accretion rate through the disk led to the 1998 bright state . 
 all flickering disappeared in 1999 , when the accreting wd was eclipsed by the red giant orbiting with a period of approximately 14 yr , according to the ephemeris of hinkle et al . and 
 the interpretation of eyres et al . 
 we did not find any evidence for periodic or quasi - periodic oscillations in the optical emission from ch cygni in either the high or low state , and we discuss the implications for magnetic propeller models of this system . as one alternative to propeller models , we propose that the activity in ch cygni is driven by accretion through a disk with a thermal - viscous instability , similar to the instabilities believed to exist in dwarf novae and suggested for fu ori pre - main - sequence stars and soft x - ray transients ."

 elastic phase transitions happen when normal modes in crystals become soft due to the vanishing of certain elastic constants .

"the standard technique for measurement of random uncertainties of star formation histories ( sfhs ) is the bootstrap monte carlo , in which the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) is repeatedly resampled . 
 the variation in sfhs measured from the resampled cmds is assumed to represent the random uncertainty in the sfh measured from the original data . 
 however , this technique systematically and significantly underestimates the uncertainties for times in which the measured star formation rate is low or zero , leading to overly ( and incorrectly ) high confidence in that measurement . 
 this study proposes an alternative technique , the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) , which samples the probability distribution of the parameters used in the original solution to directly estimate confidence intervals . while the most commonly used mcmc algorithms are incapable of adequately sampling a probability distribution that can involve thousands of highly correlated dimensions , the hybrid monte carlo algorithm is shown to be extremely effective and efficient for this particular task .

"the problem of optimally discriminating between two completely unknown qubit states is generalized by allowing an error margin . 
 it is visualized as a device  the programmable discriminator  with one data and two program ports , each fed with a number of identically prepared qubits  the data and the programs . 
 the device aims at correctly identifying the data state with one of the two program states . 
 this scheme has the unambiguous and the minimum error schemes as extremal cases , when the error margin is set to zero or it is sufficiently large , respectively . 
 analytical results are given in the two situations where the margin is imposed on the average error probability  weak condition  or it is imposed separately on the two probabilities of assigning the state of the data to the wrong program  strong condition . 
 it is a general feature of our scheme that the success probability rises sharply as soon as a small error margin is allowed , thus providing a significant gain over the unambiguous scheme while still having high confidence results ."
"the advent of social media expands our ability to transmit information and connect with others instantly , which enables us to behave as `` social sensors . '' here , we studied concurrent bursty behavior of twitter users during major sporting events to determine their function as social sensors . we show that the degree of concurrent bursts in tweets ( posts ) and retweets ( re - posts ) works as a strong indicator of winning or losing a game . 
 more specifically , our simple tweet analysis of japanese professional baseball games in 2013 revealed that social sensors can immediately react to positive and negative events through bursts of tweets , but that positive events are more likely to induce a subsequent burst of retweets . 
 we confirm that these findings also hold true for tweets related to major league baseball games in 2015 . 
 furthermore , we demonstrate active interactions among social sensors by constructing retweet networks during a baseball game . 
 the resulting networks commonly exhibited user clusters depending on the baseball team , with a scale - free connectedness that is indicative of a substantial difference in user popularity as an information source . while previous studies have mainly focused on bursts of tweets as a simple indicator of a real - world event , the temporal correlation between tweets and retweets implies unique aspects of social sensors , offering new insights into human behavior in a highly connected world ."

"the role of long range badly screened coulomb interactions in a one - dimensional chain of josephson junctions is studied .

"recently , a quasi - orthogonal space - time block code ( qstbc ) capable of achieving a significant fraction of the outage mutual information of a multiple - input - multiple output ( mimo ) wireless communication system for the case of four transmit and one receive antennas was proposed . 
 we generalize these results to @xmath0 transmit and an arbitrary number of receive antennas @xmath1 . 
 furthermore , we completely characterize the structure of the equivalent channel for the general case and show that for all @xmath0 and @xmath1 the eigenvectors of the equivalent channel are fixed and independent from the channel realization . 
 furthermore , the eigenvalues of the equivalent channel are independent identically distributed random variables each following a noncentral chi - square distribution with @xmath2 degrees of freedom . based on these important insights into the structure of the qstbc , we derive an analytical lower bound for the fraction of outage probability achieved with qstbc and show that this bound is tight for low signal - to - noise - ratios ( snr ) values and also for increasing number of receive antennas . 
 we also present an upper bound , which is tight for high snr values and derive analytical expressions for the case of four transmit antennas . 
 finally , by utilizing the special structure of the qstbc we propose a new transmit strategy , which decouples the signals transmitted from different antennas in order to detect the symbols separately with a linear ml - detector rather than joint detection , an up to now only known advantage of orthogonal space - time block codes ( ostbc ) ."

 the variation of the curvature with time can be used to infer the dynamics of actin filaments at the bacterial surface ."
"we report the first wide - field mapping of the kinematics and stellar populations in the e3 galaxy ngc4365 . 
 the velocity maps extend previous long - slit work . 
 they show two independent kinematic subsystems : the central @xmath0  pc rotates about the projected minor axis , and the main body of the galaxy , @xmath1  kpc , rotates almost at right angles to this . 
 the line - strength maps show that the metallicity of the stellar population decreases from a central value greater than solar , to one - half solar at a radius of 2  kpc . 
 the decoupled core and main body of the galaxy have the same luminosity - weighted age , of @xmath214  gyr , and the same elevated magnesium - to - iron ratio . 
 the two kinematically distinct components have thus shared a common star formation history . 
 we infer that the galaxy underwent a sequence of mergers associated with dissipative star formation that ended @xmath312  gyr ago . 
 the misalignment between the photometric and kinematic axes of the main body is unambiguous evidence of triaxiality . 
 the similarity of the stellar populations in the two components suggests that the observed kinematic structure has not changed substantially in 12  gyr .

"using the nonequilibrium theory of superconductivity with the tunnel hamiltonian , we consider a mesoscopic nisinisin heterostructure , i.e. , a structure consisting of five intermittent normal - metal ( n ) and superconducting ( s ) regions separated by insulating tunnel barriers ( i ) . applying the bias voltage between the outer normal electrodes one can drive the central n island very far from equilibrium . depending on the resistance ratio of outer and inner tunnel junctions 
 , one can realize either effective electron cooling in the central n island or create highly nonequilibrium energy distributions of electrons in both s and n islands . 
 these distributions exhibit multiple peaks at a distance of integer multiples of the superconducting chemical potential . in the latter case the superconducting gap in the s islands 
 is strongly suppressed as compared to its equilibrium value ."

 it is shown that in some cases the linear analysis is not enough to reach a definite conclusion on the stability , and molecular dynamics simulation results are presented to elucidate these cases .

 is included so as to accommodate the physics of a fermi surface in the problem . 
 we apply the p - h dmrg method to this test problem for two @xmath0 values , one for which the shell model can be solved exactly and one for which the size of the hamiltonian is much too large for exact treatment . in the former case , 
 the method is able to reproduce the exact results for the ground state energy , the energies of low  lying excited states , and other observables with extreme precision . in the latter case , the results exhibit rapid exponential convergence , suggesting the great promise of this new methodology even for more realistic nuclear systems .

"* abstract*we suggest a new mechanism to account for the loss of angular momentum in binaries with non - conservative mass exchange .

 it becomes possible to explain the existence of some observed cataclysmic binaries with high donor / accretor mass ratio , which was prohibited in conservative evolution models .

"using a non - thermal local search , called extremal optimization ( eo ) , in conjunction with a recently developed scheme for classifying the valley structure of complex systems , we analyze a short - range spin glass . in comparison with earlier studies using a thermal algorithm with detailed balance , 
 we determine which features of the landscape are algorithm dependent and which are inherently geometrical . 
 apparently a characteristic for any local search in complex energy landscapes , the time series of successive energy records found by eo also is characterized approximately by a log - poisson statistics . 
 differences in the results provide additional insights into the performance of eo . 
 in contrast with a thermal search , the extremal search visits dramatically higher energies while returning to more widely separated low - energy configurations . 
 two important properties of the energy landscape are independent of either algorithm : first , to find lower energy records , progressively higher energy barriers need to be overcome . 
 second , the hamming distance between two consecutive low - energy records is linearly related to the height of the intervening barrier .

"gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are believed to be powered by the electromagnetic extraction of spin energy from a black hole endowed with a magnetic field supported by electric currents in a surrounding disk ( blandford & znajek  1977 ) .

 , we are looking precisely for such exponential decay in the light curves of long duration grbs observed with the xrt instrument on the swift satellite . 
 we found out that almost 30% of xrt light curves show such behavior before they reach the afterglow plateau . according to blandford & znajek , the duration of the burst depends on the magnetic flux accumulated on the event horizon .

"we investigate how insights from statistical physics , namely survey propagation , can improve decoding of a particular class of sparse error correcting codes . 
 we show that a recently proposed algorithm , time averaged belief propagation , is in fact intimately linked to a specific survey propagation for which parisi s replica symmetry breaking parameter is set to zero , and that the latter is always superior to belief propagation in the high connectivity limit . 
 we briefly look at further improvements available by going to the second level of replica symmetry breaking ."
"the electrical conductivity of graphene with a nonzero mass - gap parameter is investigated starting from the first principles of quantum electrodynamics in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional space - time at any temperature . 
 the formalism of the polarization tensor defined over the entire plane of complex frequency is used . at zero temperature 
 we reproduce the results for both real and imaginary parts of the conductivity , obtained previously in the local approximation , and generalize them taking into account the effects of nonlocality . at nonzero temperature 
 the exact analytic expressions for real and imaginary parts of the longitudinal and transverse conductivities of gapped graphene are derived , as well as their local limits and approximate expressions in several asymptotic regimes . 
 specifically , a simple local result for the real part of conductivity of gapped graphene valid at any temperature is obtained . according to our results , 
 the real part of the conductivity is not equal to zero for frequencies exceeding the width of the gap and goes to the universal conductivity with increasing frequency . 
 the imaginary part of conductivity of gapped graphene varies from infinity at zero frequency to minus infinity at the frequency defined by the gap parameter and then goes to zero with further increase of frequency . 
 the analytic expressions are accompanied by the results of numerical computations . 
 possible future generalization of the used formalism is discussed ."
"we study how large functional networks can grow stably under possible cascading overload failures and evaluated the maximum stable network size above which even a small - scale failure would cause a fatal breakdown of the network . employing a model of cascading failures induced by temporally fluctuating loads , the maximum stable size @xmath0 has been calculated as a function of the load reduction parameter @xmath1 that characterizes how quickly the total load is reduced during the cascade . if we reduce the total load sufficiently fast ( @xmath2 ) , the network can grow infinitely . otherwise , @xmath0 is finite and increases with @xmath1 . for a fixed @xmath3 , @xmath0 for a scale - free network is larger than that for an exponential network with the same average degree . 
 we also discuss how one detects and avoids the crisis of a fatal breakdown of the network from the relation between the sizes of the initial network and the largest component after an ordinarily occurring cascading failure ."
"nonlinear dynamics in the fundamental interaction between a two - level atom with recoil and a quantized radiation field in a high - quality cavity is studied . 
 we consider the strongly coupled atom - field system as a quantum - classical hybrid with dynamically coupled quantum and classical degrees of freedom . 
 we show that , even in the absence of any other interaction with environment , the interaction of the purely quantum atom - field system with the external atomic degree of freedom provides the emergence of classical dynamical chaos from quantum electrodynamics . 
 atomic fractals with self - similar intermittency of smooth and unresolved structures are found in the exit - time scattering function . 
 tiny interplay between all the degrees of freedom is responsible for dynamical trapping of atoms even in a very short microcavity . 
 gedanken experiments are proposed to detect manifestations of atomic fractals in cavity quantum electrodynamics ."
"advances in nanotechnology lead to an increasing interest in how nanoparticles interact with biomembranes . 
 nanoparticles are wrapped spontaneously by biomembranes if the adhesive interactions between the particles and membranes compensate for the cost of membrane bending . in the last years , the cooperative wrapping of spherical nanoparticles in membrane tubules has been observed in experiments and simulations . for spherical nanoparticles 
 , the stability of the particle - filled membrane tubules strongly depends on the range of the adhesive particle - membrane interactions . in this article 
 , we show via modeling and energy minimization that elongated and patchy particles are wrapped cooperatively in membrane tubules that are highly stable for all ranges of the particle - membrane interactions , compared to individual wrapping of the particles . 
 the cooperative wrapping of linear chains of elongated or patchy particles in membrane tubules may thus provide an efficient route to induce membrane tubulation , or to store such particles in membranes ."
